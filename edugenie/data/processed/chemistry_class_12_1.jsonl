In normal life we rarely come across pure substances. Most of these are mixtures containing two or more pure substances. Their utility or importance in life depends on their composition. For example, the properties of brass (mixture of copper and zinc) are quite different from those of German silver (mixture of copper, zinc and nickel) or bronze (mixture of copper and tin); 1 part per million (ppm) of fluoride ions in water prevents tooth decay, while 1.5 ppm causes the tooth to become mottled and high concentrations of fluoride ions can be poisonous (for example, sodium fluoride is used in rat poison); intravenous injections are always dissolved in water containing salts at particular ionic concentrations that match with blood plasma concentrations and so on. In this Unit, we will consider mostly liquid solutions and their formation. This will be followed by studying the properties of the solutions, like vapour pressure and colligative properties. We will begin with types of solutions and then various alternatives in which concentrations of a solute can be expressed in liquid solution.

Here each component may be solid, liquid or in gaseous state and are summarised in Table 1.1. Composition of a solution can be described by expressing its concentration. The latter can be expressed either qualitatively or quantitatively. For example, qualitatively we can say that the solution is dilute (i.e., relatively very small quantity of solute) or it is concentrated (i.e., relatively very large quantity of solute). But in real life these kinds of description can add to lot of confusion and thus the need for a quantitative description of the solution.

This process is known as dissolution. Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute particles and get separated out of solution. This process is known as crystallisation. A stage is reached when the two processes occur at the same rate. Under such conditions, number of solute particles going into solution will be equal to the solute particles separating out and a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached. Solute + Solvent \u21cc Solution (1.10) At this stage the concentration of solute in solution will remain constant under the given conditions, i.e., temperature and pressure. Similar process is followed when gases are dissolved in liquid solvents. Such a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature and pressure is called a saturated solution. An unsaturated solution is one in which more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature. The solution which is in dynamic equilibrium with undissolved solute is the saturated solution and contains the maximum amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent. Thus, the concentration of solute in such a solution is its solubility. Earlier we have observed that solubility of one substance into another depends on the nature of the substances. In addition to these variables, two other parameters, i.e., temperature and pressure also control this phenomenon. Effect of temperature The solubility of a solid in a liquid is significantly affected by temperature changes. Consider the equilibrium represented by equation 1.10.

It is so because solids and liquids are highly incompressible and practically remain unaffected by changes in pressure. Many gases dissolve in water. Oxygen dissolves only to a small extent in water. It is this dissolved oxygen which sustains all aquatic life. On the other hand, hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) is highly soluble in water.

Assume this system to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e., under these conditions rate of gaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same. Now increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the gas to a smaller volume [Fig. 1.1 (b)]. This will increase the number of gaseous particles per unit volume over the solution and also the rate at which the gaseous particles are striking the surface of solution to enter it.

{"source": "chemistry_class_12_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 9, "content": "Henry was the first to give a quantitative relation between pressure and solubility of a gas in a solvent which is known as Henry\u2019s law. The law states that at a constant temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas present above the surface of liquid or solution. Dalton, a contemporary of Henry, also concluded independently that the solubility of a gas in a liquid solution is a function of partial pressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in the solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be said that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas over the solution. The most commonly used form of Henry\u2019s law states that \u201cthe partial pressure of the gas in vapour phase (p) is proportional to the mole fraction of the gas (x) in the solution\u201d and is expressed as: p = KH x (1.11) Here KH is the Henry\u2019s law constant. If we draw a graph between partial pressure of the gas versus mole fraction of the gas in solution, then we should get a plot of the type as shown in Fig. 1.2. Different gases have different KH values at the same temperature (Table 1.2). This suggests that KH is a function of the nature of the gas. It is obvious from equation (1.11) that higher the value of KH at a given pressure, the lower is the solubility of the gas in the liquid.

In a pure liquid the entire surface is occupied by the molecules of the liquid. If a non-volatile solute is added to a solvent to give a solution [Fig. 1.4. (b)], the vapour pressure of the solution is solely from the solvent alone. This vapour pressure of the solution at a given temperature is found to be lower than the vapour pressure of the pure solvent at the same temperature. In the solution, the surface has both solute and solvent molecules; thereby the fraction of the surface covered by the solvent molecules gets reduced. Consequently, the number of solvent molecules escaping from the surface is correspondingly reduced, thus, the vapour pressure is also reduced. The decrease in the vapour pressure of solvent depends on the quantity of non-volatile solute present in the solution, irrespective of its nature. For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by adding 1.0 mol of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that produced by adding 1.0 mol of urea to the same quantity of water at the same temperature. Raoult\u2019s law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction."}

Liquid-liquid solutions can be classified into ideal and non-ideal solutions on the basis of Raoult\u2019s law. The solutions which obey Raoult\u2019s law over the entire range of concentration are known as ideal solutions. The ideal solutions have two other important properties. The enthalpy of mixing of the pure components to form the solution is zero and the volume of mixing is also zero, i.e., DmixH = 0, DmixV = 0 (1.21) It means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components are mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of volumes of the two components."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_12_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 19, "content": "At molecular level, ideal behaviour of the solutions can be explained by considering two components A and B. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will be of types A-A and B-B, whereas in the binary solutions in addition to these two interactions, A-B type of interactions will also be present. If the intermolecular attractive forces between the A-A and B-B are nearly equal to those between A-B, this leads to the formation of ideal solution. A perfectly ideal solution is rare but some solutions are nearly ideal in behaviour. Solution of n-hexane and n-heptane, bromoethane and chloroethane, benzene and toluene, etc. fall into this category. When a solution does not obey Raoult\u2019s law over the entire range of concentration, then it is called non-ideal solution. The vapour pressure of such a solution is either higher or lower than that predicted by Raoult\u2019s law (equation 1.16). If it is higher, the solution exhibits positive deviation and if it is lower, it exhibits negative deviation from Raoult\u2019s law. The plots of vapour pressure as a function of mole fractions for such solutions are shown in Fig. 1.6. The cause for these deviations lie in the nature of interactions at the molecular level. In case of positive deviation from Raoult\u2019s law, A-B interactions are weaker than those between A-A or B-B, i.e., in this case the intermolecular attractive forces between the solute-solvent molecules are weaker than those between the solute-solute and solvent-solvent molecules. This means that in such solutions, molecules of A (or B) will find it easier to escape than in pure state. This will increase the vapour Fig. 1.5 If a solution obeys Raoult's law for all concentrations, its vapour pressure would vary linearly from zero to the vapour pressure of the pure solvent."}

Mixtures of ethanol and acetone behave in this manner. In pure ethanol, molecules are hydrogen bonded. On adding acetone, its molecules get in between the host molecules and break some of the hydrogen bonds between them. Due to weakening of interactions, the solution shows positive deviation from Raoult\u2019s law [Fig. 1.6 (a)]. In a solution formed by adding carbon disulphide to acetone, the dipolar interactions between solute-solvent molecules are weaker than the respective interactions among the solute-solute and solvent-solvent molecules. This solution also shows positive deviation. In case of negative deviations from Raoult\u2019s law, the intermolecular attractive forces between A-A and B-B are weaker than those between A-B and leads to decrease in vapour pressure resulting in negative deviations. An example of this type is a mixture of phenol and aniline. In this case the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic proton and lone pair on nitrogen atom of aniline is stronger than the respective intermolecular hydrogen bonding between similar molecules. Similarly, a mixture of chloroform and acetone forms a solution with negative deviation from Raoult\u2019s law. This is because chloroform molecule is able to form hydrogen bond with acetone molecule as shown. This decreases the escaping tendency of molecules for each component and consequently the vapour pressure decreases resulting in negative deviation from Raoult\u2019s law [Fig. 1.6. (b)].

The flow of the solvent from its side to solution side across a semipermeable membrane can be stopped if some extra pressure is applied on the solution. This pressure that just stops the flow of solvent is called osmotic pressure of the solution. The flow of solvent from dilute solution to the concentrated solution across a semipermeable membrane is due to osmosis. The important point to be kept in mind is that solvent molecules always flow from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution. The osmotic pressure has been found to depend on the concentration of the solution.

The preservation of meat by salting and of fruits by adding sugar protects against bacterial action. Through the process of osmosis, a bacterium on salted meat or candid fruit loses water, shrivels and dies. The direction of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure larger than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution side. That is, now the pure solvent flows out of the solution through the semi permeable membrane. This phenomenon is called reverse osmosis and is of great practical utility. Reverse osmosis is used in desalination of sea water. A schematic set up for the process is shown in Fig. 1.11. When pressure more than osmotic pressure is applied, pure water is squeezed out of the sea water through the membrane. A variety of polymer membranes are available for this purpose. The pressure required for the reverse osmosis is quite high. A workable porous membrane is a film of cellulose acetate placed over a suitable support. Cellulose acetate is permeable to water but impermeable to impurities and ions present in sea water. These days many countries use desalination plants to meet their potable water requirements."}

This brings into light the rule that, when there is dissociation of solute into ions, the experimentally determined molar mass is always lower than the true value. Molecules of ethanoic acid (acetic acid) dimerise in benzene due to hydrogen bonding. This normally happens in solvents of low dielectric constant. In this case the number of particles is reduced due to dimerisation. Association of molecules is depicted as follows: It can be undoubtedly stated here that if all the molecules of ethanoic acid associate in benzene, then DTb or DTf for ethanoic acid will be half of the normal value. The molar mass calculated on the basis of this DTb or DTf will, therefore, be twice the expected value. Such a molar mass that is either lower or higher than the expected or normal value is called as abnormal molar mass. In 1880 van\u2019t Hoff introduced a factor i, known as the van\u2019t Hoff factor, to account for the extent of dissociation or association. This factor i is defined as: Normal molar mass Abnormal molar mass \uf03d i Observed colligative property Calculated colligative property \uf03d Total number of moles of particles after association/dissociation Number of moles of particles before association/dissociation \uf03d i Here abnormal molar mass is the experimentally determined molar mass and calculated colligative properties are obtained by assuming that the non-volatile solute is neither associated nor dissociated.

The dissolution of a gas in a liquid is governed by Henry\u2019s law, according to which, at a given temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas. The vapour pressure of the solvent is lowered by the presence of a non-volatile solute in the solution and this lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent is governed by Raoult\u2019s law, according to which the relative lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent over a solution is equal to the mole fraction of a non-volatile solute present in the solution. However, in a binary liquid solution, if both the components of the solution are volatile then another form of Raoult\u2019s law is used.

The copper electrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode, the oxidation half-cell. We can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern of Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each half- cell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two half-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a switch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected internally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1. Sometimes, both the electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we do not require a salt bridge. At each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal ions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make it positively charged."}

At equilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the tendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively or negatively charged with respect to the solution. A potential difference develops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called electrode potential. When the concentrations of all the species involved in a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard electrode potential. According to IUPAC convention, standard reduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a galvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other half-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a positive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a potential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the switch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode to positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of electron flow. 2.2 Galvanic Cells 2.2 Galvanic Cells 2.2 Galvanic Cells 2.2 Galvanic Cells 2.2 Galvanic Cells Reprint 2025-26 34 Chemistry The potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic cell is called the cell potential and is measured in volts. The cell potential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive force (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell."}

A galvanic cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal and electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between the two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention the emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the half- cell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the left hand side i.e., Ecell = Eright \u2013 Eleft This is illustrated by the following example: Cell reaction: Cu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) \u00be\u00ae Cu2+(aq) + 2 Ag(s) (2.4) Half-cell reactions: Cathode (reduction): 2Ag+(aq) + 2e\u2013 \u00ae 2Ag(s) (2.5) Anode (oxidation): Cu(s) \u00ae Cu2+(aq) + 2e\u2013 (2.6) It can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction (2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper electrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as: Cu(s)|Cu2+(aq)||Ag+(aq)|Ag(s) and we have Ecell = Eright \u2013 Eleft = EAg+\u00faAg \u2013 ECu2+\u00faCu (2.7) The potential of individual half-cell cannot be measured. We can measure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one electrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect to this. According to convention, a half-cell called standard hydrogen electrode (Fig.3.3) represented by Pt(s)\u00fa H2(g)\u00fa H+(aq), is assigned a zero potential at all temperatures corresponding to the reaction H+ (aq) + e\u2013 \u00ae 1 2 H2(g) The standard hydrogen electrode consists of a platinum electrode coated with platinum black.

The negative value of the standard electrode potential in the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or zinc can reduce hydrogen ions).

Materials are classified into conductors, insulators and semiconductors depending on the magnitude of their conductivity.

Earlier, only metals and their alloys at very low temperatures (0 to 15 K) were known to behave as superconductors, but nowadays a number of ceramic materials and mixed oxides are also known to show superconductivity at temperatures as high as 150 K. Electrical conductance through metals is called metallic or electronic conductance and is due to the movement of electrons. The electronic conductance depends on (i) the nature and structure of the metal (ii) the number of valence electrons per atom (iii) temperature (it decreases with increase of temperature)."}

The mechanism of conductance through semiconductors is more complex. We already know that even very pure water has small amounts of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions (~10\u20137M) which lend it very low conductivity (3.5 \u00d7 10\u20135 S m\u20131). When electrolytes are dissolved in water, they furnish their own ions in the solution hence its conductivity also increases. The conductance of electricity by ions present in the solutions is called electrolytic or ionic conductance. The conductivity of electrolytic (ionic) solutions depends on: (i) the nature of the electrolyte added (ii) size of the ions produced and their solvation (iii) the nature of the solvent and its viscosity (iv) concentration of the electrolyte (v) temperature (it increases with the increase of temperature). Passage of direct current through ionic solution over a prolonged period can lead to change in its composition due to electrochemical reactions (Section 2.4.1). We know that accurate measurement of an unknown resistance can be performed on a Wheatstone bridge. However, for measuring the resistance of an ionic solution we face two problems. Firstly, passing direct current (DC) changes the composition of the solution. Secondly, a solution cannot be connected to the bridge like a metallic wire or other solid conductor."}

The electrochemical processes are of great importance in the laboratory and the chemical industry. One of the simplest electrolytic cell consists of two copper strips dipping in an aqueous solution of copper sulphate. If a DC voltage is applied to the two electrodes, then Cu 2+ ions discharge at the cathode (negatively charged) and the following reaction takes place: Cu2+(aq) + 2e\u2013 \u00ae Cu (s) (2.28) Copper metal is deposited on the cathode. At the anode, copper is converted into Cu2+ ions by the reaction: Cu(s) \u00ae Cu2+(s) + 2e\u2013 (2.29) Thus copper is dissolved (oxidised) at anode and deposited (reduced) at cathode. This is the basis for an industrial process in which impure copper is converted into copper of high purity. The impure copper is made an anode that dissolves on passing current and pure copper is deposited at the cathode. Many metals like Na, Mg, Al, etc. are produced on large scale by electrochemical reduction of their respective cations where no suitable chemical reducing agents are available for this purpose.

The amount of electricity (or charge) required for oxidation or reduction depends on the stoichiometry of the electrode reaction. For example, in the reaction: Ag +(aq) + e\u2013 \u00ae Ag(s) (2.30) One mole of the electron is required for the reduction of one mole of silver ions. We know that charge on one electron is equal to 1.6021 \u00d7 10\u201319C.

The charge passed through the electrolytic cell during electrolysis is equal to the product of current in amperes and time in seconds. In commercial production of metals, current as high as 50,000 amperes are used that amounts to about 0.518 F per second.

Example 2.10 Example 2.10 Example 2.10 Example 2.10 Example 2.10 Solution Solution Solution Solution Solution Products of electrolysis depend on the nature of material being electrolysed and the type of electrodes being used. If the electrode is inert (e.g., platinum or gold), it does not participate in the chemical reaction and acts only as source or sink for electrons. On the other hand, if the electrode is reactive, it participates in the electrode reaction. Thus, the products of electrolysis may be different for reactive and inert 2.5.1 Products of Electrolysis Reprint 2025-26 53 Electrochemistry electrodes.The products of electrolysis depend on the different oxidising and reducing species present in the electrolytic cell and their standard electrode potentials. Moreover, some of the electrochemical processes although feasible, are so slow kinetically that at lower voltages these do not seem to take place and extra potential (called overpotential) has to be applied, which makes such process more difficult to occur. For example, if we use molten NaCl, the products of electrolysis are sodium metal and Cl2 gas. Here we have only one cation (Na+) which is reduced at the cathode (Na+ + e\u2013 \u00ae Na) and one anion (Cl\u2013) which is oxidised at the anode (Cl\u2013 \u00ae \u00bdCl2 + e\u2013 ) .

In the primary batteries, the reaction occurs only once and after use over a period of time battery becomes dead and cannot be reused again.

These have been used in automobiles on an experimental basis. Fuel cells are pollution free and in view of their future importance, a variety of fuel cells have been fabricated and tried. Corrosion slowly coats the surfaces of metallic objects with oxides or other salts of the metal. The rusting of iron, tarnishing of silver, development of green coating on copper and bronze are some of the examples of corrosion. It causes enormous damage to buildings, bridges, ships and to all objects made of metals especially that of iron. We lose crores of rupees every year on account of corrosion. In corrosion, a metal is oxidised by loss of electrons to oxygen and formation of oxides. Corrosion of iron (commonly known as rusting) occurs in presence of water and air. The chemistry of corrosion is quite complex but it may be considered essentially as an electrochemical phenomenon. At a particular spot (Fig. 2.13) of an object made of iron, oxidation takes place and that spot behaves as anode and we can write the reaction Anode: 2 Fe (s) \u00be\u00ae 2 Fe2+ + 4 e\u2013 o 2+ (Fe /Fe) E = \u2013 0.44 V Electrons released at anodic spot move through the metal and go to another spot on the metal and reduce oxygen in the presence of H+ (which is believed to be available from H2CO3 formed due to dissolution of carbon dioxide from air into water.

Prevention of corrosion is of prime importance. It not only saves money but also helps in preventing accidents such as a bridge collapse or failure of a key component due to corrosion. One of the simplest methods of preventing corrosion is to prevent the surface of the metallic object to come in contact with atmosphere. This can be done by covering the surface with paint or by some chemicals (e.g. bisphenol). Another simple method is to cover the surface by other metals (Sn, Zn, etc.) that are inert or react to save the object. An electrochemical method is to provide a sacrificial electrode of another metal (like Mg, Zn, etc.) which corrodes itself but saves the object. 2.8 2.8 2.8 2.8 2.8 Corrosion Corrosion Corrosion Corrosion Corrosion Reprint 2025-26 58 Chemistry The Hydrogen Economy The Hydrogen Economy The Hydrogen Economy The Hydrogen Economy The Hydrogen Economy At present the main source of energy that is driving our economy is fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas.

The standard potential of the cell can be obtained by taking the difference of the standard potentials of cathode and anode ( ( ) o cell E = Eocathode \u2013 Eoanode). The standard potential of the cells are related to standard Gibbs energy (DrGo = \u2013nF ( ) o cell E ) and equilibrium constant (DrGo = \u2013 RT ln K) of the reaction taking place in the cell. Concentration dependence of the potentials of the electrodes and the cells are given by Nernst equation. The conductivity, k, of an electrolytic solution depends on the concentration of the electrolyte, nature of solvent and temperature. Molar conductivity, Lm, is defined by = k/c where c is the concentration. Conductivity decreases but molar conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. It increases slowly with decrease in concentration for strong electrolytes while the increase is very steep for weak electrolytes in very dilute solutions.

Some reactions such as ionic reactions occur very fast, for example, precipitation of silver chloride occurs instantaneously by mixing of aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride. On the other hand, some reactions are very slow, for example, rusting of iron in the presence of air and moisture. Also there are reactions like inversion of cane sugar and hydrolysis of starch, which proceed with a moderate speed. Can you think of more examples from each category? You must be knowing that speed of an automobile is expressed in terms of change in the position or distance covered by it in a certain period of time. Similarly, the speed of a reaction or the rate of a reaction can be defined as the change in concentration of a reactant or product in unit time. To be more specific, it can be expressed in terms of: (i) the rate of decrease in concentration of any one of the reactants, or (ii) the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products. Consider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the system remains constant. R \u00ae P One mole of the reactant R produces one mole of the product P. If [R]1 and [P]1 are the concentrations of R and P respectively at time t1 and [R]2 and [P]2 are their concentrations at time t2 then, Dt = t2 \u2013 t1 D[R] = [R]2 \u2013 [R]1 D [P] = [P]2 \u2013 [P]1 The square brackets in the above expressions are used to express molar concentration."}

The thermal decomposition of HI on gold surface is another example of zero order reaction.

In reality, it is a second order reaction and concentration of both ethyl acetate and water affect the rate of the reaction.

According to this theory, a catalyst participates in a chemical reaction by forming temporary bonds with the reactants resulting in an intermediate complex. This has a transitory existence and decomposes to yield products and the catalyst. It is believed that the catalyst provides an alternate pathway or reaction mechanism by reducing the activation energy between reactants and products and hence lowering the potential energy barrier as shown in Fig. 3.11. It is clear from Arrhenius equation (3.18) that lower the value of activation energy faster will be the rate of a reaction. A small amount of the catalyst can catalyse a large amount of reactants.

Comparing (3.23) with Arrhenius equation, we can say that A is related to collision frequency. Equation (3.23) predicts the value of rate constants fairly accurately for the reactions that involve atomic species or simple molecules but for complex molecules significant deviations are observed. The reason could be that all collisions do not lead to the formation of products. The collisions in which molecules collide with sufficient kinetic energy (called threshold energy*) and proper orientation, so as to facilitate breaking of bonds between reacting species and formation of new bonds to form products are called as effective collisions. For example, formation of methanol from bromoethane depends upon the orientation of reactant molecules as shown in Fig. 3.12. The proper orientation of reactant molecules lead to bond formation whereas improper orientation makes them simply bounce back and no products are formed. To account for effective collisions, another factor P, called the probability or steric factor is introduced. It takes into account the fact that in a collision, molecules must be properly oriented i.e., a / AB Rate Z e E RT P \u2212 = Thus, in collision theory activation energy and proper orientation of the molecules together determine the criteria for an effective collision and hence the rate of a chemical reaction.

Summary Summary Summary Summary Summary Chemical kinetics is the study of chemical reactions with respect to reaction rates, effect of various variables, rearrangement of atoms and formation of intermediates. The rate of a reaction is concerned with decrease in concentration of reactants or increase in the concentration of products per unit time. It can be expressed as instantaneous rate at a particular instant of time and average rate over a large interval of time. A number of factors such as temperature, concentration of reactants, catalyst, affect the rate of a reaction. Mathematical representation of rate of a reaction is given by rate law. It has to be determined experimentally and cannot be predicted. Order of a reaction with respect to a reactant is the power of its concentration which appears in the rate law equation. The order of a reaction is the sum of all such powers of concentration of terms for different reactants. Rate constant is the proportionality factor in the rate law."}

Molecularity is defined only for an elementary reaction. Its values are limited from 1 to 3 whereas order can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or even a fraction. Molecularity and order of an elementary reaction are same. Temperature dependence of rate constants is described by Arrhenius equation (k = Ae\u2013Ea/RT). Ea corresponds to the activation energy and is given by the energy difference between activated complex and the reactant molecules, and A (Arrhenius factor or pre-exponential factor) corresponds to the collision frequency. The equation clearly shows that increase of temperature or lowering of Ea will lead to an increase in the rate of reaction and presence of a catalyst lowers the activation energy by providing an alternate path for the reaction.

Hence, transition elements and their compounds are studied separately. However, the usual theory of valence as applicable to the non- transition elements can be applied successfully to the transition elements also. Various precious metals such as silver, gold and platinum and industrially important metals like iron, copper and titanium belong to the transition metals series. In this Unit, we shall first deal with the electronic configuration, occurrence and general characteristics of transition elements with special emphasis on the trends in the properties of the first row (3d) transition metals along with the preparation and properties of some important compounds. This will be followed by consideration of certain general aspects such as electronic configurations, oxidation states and chemical reactivity of the inner transition metals. THE TRANSITION ELEMENTS (d-BLOCK) The d\u2013block occupies the large middle section of the periodic table flanked between s\u2013 and p\u2013 blocks in the periodic table. The d\u2013orbitals of the penultimate energy level of atoms receive electrons giving rise to four rows of the transition metals, i.e., 3d, 4d, 5d and 6d.

The (n\u20131) stands for the inner d orbitals which may have one to ten electrons and the outermost ns orbital may have one or two electrons. However, this generalisation has several exceptions because of very little energy difference between (n-1)d and ns orbitals. Furthermore, half and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A consequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations of Cr and Cu in the 3d series."}

{"source": "chemistry_class_12_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 135, "content": "4.2 is that the metals of the second and third series have greater enthalpies of atomisation than the corresponding elements of the first series; this is an important factor in accounting for the occurrence of much more frequent metal \u2013 metal bonding in compounds of the heavy transition metals. Fig. 4.2 Trends in enthalpies of atomisation of transition elements In general, ions of the same charge in a given series show progressive decrease in radius with increasing atomic number. This is because the new electron enters a d orbital each time the nuclear charge increases by unity. It may be recalled that the shielding effect of a d electron is not that effective, hence the net electrostatic attraction between the nuclear charge and the outermost electron increases and the ionic radius decreases. The same trend is observed in the atomic radii of a given series. However, the variation within a series is quite small. An interesting point emerges when atomic sizes of one series are compared with those of the corresponding elements in the other series. The curves in Fig. 4.3 show an increase from the first (3d) to the second (4d) series of the elements but the radii of the third (5d) series are virtually the same as those of the corresponding members of the second series. This phenomenon is associated with the intervention of the 4f orbitals which must be filled before the 5d series of elements begin. The filling of 4f before 5d orbital results in a regular decrease in atomic radii called Lanthanoid contraction which essentially compensates for the expected 4.3.2 Variation in Atomic and Ionic Sizes of Transition Metals DaH V/kJ mol \u20131 Reprint 2025-26 94 Chemistry increase in atomic size with increasing atomic number."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_12_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 136, "content": "The net result of the lanthanoid contraction is that the second and the third d series exhibit similar radii (e.g., Zr 160 pm, Hf 159 pm) and have very similar physical and chemical properties much more than that expected on the basis of usual family relationship. The factor responsible for the lanthanoid contraction is somewhat similar to that observed in an ordinary transition series and is attributed to similar cause, i.e., the imperfect shielding of one electron by another in the same set of orbitals. However, the shielding of one 4f electron by another is less than that of one d electron by another, and as the nuclear charge increases along the series, there is fairly regular decrease in the size of the entire 4f n orbitals.

Example 4.2 Example 4.2 Example 4.2 Example 4.2 Example 4.2 Solution Solution Solution Solution Solution There is an increase in ionisation enthalpy along each series of the transition elements from left to right due to an increase in nuclear charge which accompanies the filling of the inner d orbitals. Table 4.2 gives the values of the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first series of transition elements. These values show that the successive enthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as in the case of non-transition elements. The variation in ionisation enthalpy along a series of transition elements is much less in comparison to the variation along a period of non-transition elements. The first ionisation enthalpy, in general, increases, but the magnitude of the increase in the second and third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements, is much higher along a series. The irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the metals of 3d series, though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for by considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies of 4s and 3d orbitals. You have learnt that when d-block elements form ions, ns electrons are lost before (n \u2013 1) d electrons. As we move along the period in 3d series, we see that nuclear charge increases from scandium to zinc but electrons are added to the orbital of inner subshell, i.e., 3d orbitals. These 3d electrons shield the 4s electrons from the increasing nuclear charge somewhat more effectively than the outer shell electrons can shield one another. Therefore, the atomic radii decrease less rapidly."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_12_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 139, "content": "Thus, ionization energies increase only slightly along the 3d series. The doubly or more highly charged ions have d n configurations with no 4s electrons. A general trend of increasing values of second ionisation enthalpy is expected as the effective nuclear charge increases because one d electron does not shield another electron from the influence of nuclear charge because d-orbitals differ in direction. However, the trend of steady increase in second and third ionisation enthalpy breaks for the formation of Mn2+ and Fe3+ respectively. In both the cases, ions have d5 configuration. Similar breaks occur at corresponding elements in the later transition series. The interpretation of variation in ionisation enthalpy for an electronic configuration dn is as follows: The three terms responsible for the value of ionisation enthalpy are attraction of each electron towards nucleus, repulsion between the 4.3.3 Ionisation Enthalpies Intext Question Intext Question Intext Question Intext Question Intext Question 4.2 In the series Sc (Z = 21) to Zn (Z = 30), the enthalpy of atomisation of zinc is the lowest, i.e., 126 kJ mol \u20131. Why? Reprint 2025-26 96 Chemistry electrons and the exchange energy. Exchange energy is responsible for the stabilisation of energy state. Exchange energy is approximately proportional to the total number of possible pairs of parallel spins in the degenerate orbitals. When several electrons occupy a set of degenerate orbitals, the lowest energy state corresponds to the maximum possible extent of single occupation of orbital and parallel spins (Hunds rule). The loss of exchange energy increases the stability. As the stability increases, the ionisation becomes more difficult. There is no loss of exchange energy at d6 configuration. Mn+ has 3d54s1 configuration and configuration of Cr+ is d5, therefore, ionisation enthalpy of Mn+ is lower than Cr+."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_12_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 140, "content": "In the same way, Fe2+ has d6 configuration and Mn2+ has 3d5 configuration. Hence, ionisation enthalpy of Fe2+ is lower than the Mn2+. In other words, we can say that the third ionisation enthalpy of Fe is lower than that of Mn. The lowest common oxidation state of these metals is +2. To form the M 2+ ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and second ionisation enthalpy is required in addition to the enthalpy of atomisation. The dominant term is the second ionisation enthalpy which shows unusually high values for Cr and Cu where M + ions have the d 5 and d 10 configurations respectively. The value for Zn is correspondingly low as the ionisation causes the removal of one 4s electron which results in the formation of stable d 10 configuration. The trend in the third ionisation enthalpies is not complicated by the 4s orbital factor and shows the greater difficulty of removing an electron from the d 5 (Mn 2+) and d 10 (Zn 2+) ions. In general, the third ionisation enthalpies are quite high. Also the high values for third ionisation enthalpies of copper, nickel and zinc indicate why it is difficult to obtain oxidation state greater than two for these elements. Although ionisation enthalpies give some guidance concerning the relative stabilities of oxidation states, this problem is very complex and not amenable to ready generalisation. One of the notable features of a transition elements is the great variety of oxidation states these may show in their compounds.

Manganese, for example, exhibits all the oxidation states from +2 to +7. The lesser number of oxidation states at the extreme ends stems from either too few electrons to lose or share (Sc, Ti) or too many d electrons (hence fewer orbitals available in which to share electrons with others) for higher valence (Cu, Zn). Thus, early in the series scandium(II) is virtually unknown and titanium (IV) is more stable than Ti(III) or Ti(II). At the other end, the only oxidation state of zinc is +2 (no d electrons are involved). The maximum oxidation states of reasonable stability correspond in value to the sum of the s and d electrons upto manganese (Ti IVO2, V VO2 +, Cr V1O4 2\u2013, Mn VIIO4 \u2013) followed by a rather abrupt decrease in stability of higher oxidation states, so that the typical species to follow are Fe II,III, Co II,III, Ni II, Cu I,II, Zn II."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_12_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 142, "content": "The variability of oxidation states, a characteristic of transition elements, arises out of incomplete filling of d orbitals in such a way that their oxidation states differ from each other by unity, e.g., V II, V III, V IV, V V. This is in contrast with the variability of oxidation states of non transition elements where oxidation states normally differ by a unit of two. An interesting feature in the variability of oxidation states of the d\u2013 block elements is noticed among the groups (groups 4 through 10). Although in the p\u2013block the lower oxidation states are favoured by the heavier members (due to inert pair effect), the opposite is true in the groups of d-block. For example, in group 6, Mo(VI) and W(VI) are found to be more stable than Cr(VI). Thus Cr(VI) in the form of dichromate in acidic medium is a strong oxidising agent, whereas MoO3 and WO3 are not. Low oxidation states are found when a complex compound has ligands capable of p-acceptor character in addition to the s-bonding.

The transition metals form a large number of complex compounds. This is due to the comparatively smaller sizes of the metal ions, their high ionic charges and the availability of d orbitals for bond formation. The transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic activity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple oxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in Contact Process), finely divided iron (in Haber\u2019s Process), and nickel (in Catalytic Hydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface involve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms of the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilise 3d and 4s electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the concentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening of the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowering). Also because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states, they become more effective as catalysts.

Because of the nature of their composition, these compounds are referred to as interstitial compounds. The principal physical and chemical characteristics of these compounds are as follows: (i) They have high melting points, higher than those of pure metals. (ii) They are very hard, some borides approach diamond in hardness. (iii) They retain metallic conductivity. (iv) They are chemically inert. An alloy is a blend of metals prepared by mixing the components. Alloys may be homogeneous solid solutions in which the atoms of one metal are distributed randomly among the atoms of the other. Such alloys are formed by atoms with metallic radii that are within about 15 percent of each other. Because of similar radii and other characteristics of transition metals, alloys are readily formed by these metals. The alloys so formed are hard and have often high melting points. The best known are ferrous alloys: chromium, vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum and manganese are used for the production of a variety of steels and stainless steel. Alloys of transition metals with non transition metals such as brass (copper-zinc) and bronze (copper-tin), are also of considerable industrial importance. 4.3.12 Catalytic Properties 4.3.13 Formation of Interstitial Compounds 4.3.14 Alloy Formation Reprint 2025-26 105 The d- and f- Block Elements Intext Question Intext Question Intext Question Intext Question Intext Question 4.9 Explain why Cu + ion is not stable in aqueous solutions?"}

All the metals except scandium form MO oxides which are ionic. The highest oxidation number in the oxides, coincides with the group number and is attained in Sc2O3 to Mn2O7. Beyond group 7, no higher oxides of iron above Fe2O3 are known. Besides the oxides, the oxocations stabilise V V as VO2 +, V IV as VO 2+ and Ti IV as TiO 2+. As the oxidation number of a metal increases, ionic character decreases. In the case of Mn, Mn2O7 is a covalent green oil. Even CrO3 and V2O5 have low melting points. In these higher oxides, the acidic character is predominant. Thus, Mn2O7 gives HMnO4 and CrO3 gives H2CrO4 and H2Cr2O7. V2O5 is, however, amphoteric though mainly acidic and it gives VO4 3\u2013 as well as VO2 + salts. In vanadium there is gradual change from the basic V2O3 to less basic V2O4 and to amphoteric V2O5.

THE INNER TRANSITION ELEMENTS ( f-BLOCK) The f-block consists of the two series, lanthanoids (the fourteen elements following lanthanum) and actinoids (the fourteen elements following actinium). Because lanthanum closely resembles the lanthanoids, it is usually included in any discussion of the lanthanoids for which the general symbol Ln is often used. Similarly, a discussion of the actinoids includes actinium besides the fourteen elements constituting the series. The lanthanoids resemble one another more closely than do the members of ordinary transition elements in any series. They have only one stable oxidation state and their chemistry provides an excellent opportunity to examine the effect of small changes in size and nuclear charge along a series of otherwise similar elements. The chemistry of the actinoids is, on the other hand, much more complicated. The complication arises partly owing to the occurrence of a wide range of oxidation states in these elements and partly because their radioactivity creates special problems in their study; the two series will be considered separately here. The names, symbols, electronic configurations of atomic and some ionic states and atomic and ionic radii of lanthanum and lanthanoids (for which the general symbol Ln is used) are given in Table 4.9."}

However, the electronic configurations of all the tripositive ions (the most stable oxidation state of all the lanthanoids) are of the form 4f n (n = 1 to 14 with increasing atomic number). The overall decrease in atomic and ionic radii from lanthanum to lutetium (the lanthanoid contraction) is a unique feature in the chemistry of the lanthanoids. It has far reaching consequences in the chemistry of the third transition series of the elements. The decrease in atomic radii (derived from the structures of metals) is not quite regular as it is regular in M 3+ ions (Fig. 4.6). This contraction is, of course, similar to that observed in an ordinary transition series and is attributed to the same cause, the imperfect shielding of one electron by another in the same sub-shell. However, the shielding of one 4 f electron by another is less than one d electron by another with the increase in nuclear charge along the series. There is fairly regular decrease in the sizes with increasing atomic number."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_12_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 162, "content": "The cumulative effect of the contraction of the lanthanoid series, known as lanthanoid contraction, causes the radii of the members of the third transition series to be very similar to those of the corresponding members of the second series. The almost identical radii of Zr (160 pm) and Hf (159 pm), a consequence of the lanthanoid contraction, account for their occurrence together in nature and for the difficulty faced in their separation. In the lanthanoids, La(II) and Ln(III) compounds are predominant species. However, occasionally +2 and +4 ions in solution or in solid compounds are also obtained. This irregularity (as in ionisation enthalpies) arises mainly from the extra stability of empty, half-filled or filled f subshell. Thus, the formation of Ce IV is favoured by its noble gas configuration, but it is a strong oxidant reverting to the common +3 state. The E o value for Ce 4+/ Ce 3+ is + 1.74 V which suggests that it can oxidise water. However, the reaction rate is very slow and hence Ce(IV) is a good analytical reagent. Pr, Nd, Tb and Dy also exhibit +4 state but only in oxides, MO2. Eu 2+ is formed by losing the two s electrons and its f 7 configuration accounts for the formation of this ion. However, Eu 2+ is a strong reducing agent changing to the common +3 state. Similarly Yb 2+ which has f 14 configuration is a reductant. Tb IV has half-filled f-orbitals and is an oxidant.

Many trivalent lanthanoid ions are coloured both in the solid state and in aqueous solutions. Colour of these ions may be attributed to the presence of f electrons.

The lanthanoid ions other than the f 0 type (La 3+ and Ce 4+) and the f 14 type (Yb 2+ and Lu 3+) are all paramagnetic.

A detailed discussion of the variation of the third ionisation enthalpies indicates that the exchange enthalpy considerations (as in 3d orbitals of the first transition series), appear to impart a certain degree of stability to empty, half-filled and completely filled orbitals f level. This is indicated from the abnormally low value of the third ionisation enthalpy of lanthanum, gadolinium and lutetium.

The irregularities in the electronic configurations of the actinoids, like those in the lanthanoids are related to the stabilities of the f 0, f 7 and f 14 occupancies of the 5f orbitals. Thus, the configurations of Am and Cm are [Rn] 5f 77s 2 and [Rn] 5f 76d 17s 2. Although the 5f orbitals resemble the 4f orbitals in their angular part of the wave-function, they are not as buried as 4f orbitals and hence 5f electrons can participate in bonding to a far greater extent. The general trend in lanthanoids is observable in the actinoids as well. There is a gradual decrease in the size of atoms or M 3+ ions across the series. This may be referred to as the actinoid contraction (like lanthanoid contraction). The contraction is, however, greater from element to element in this series resulting from poor shielding by 5f electrons. There is a greater range of oxidation states, which is in part attributed to the fact that the 5f, 6d and 7s levels are of comparable energies. The known oxidation states of actinoids are listed in Table 4.11. The actinoids show in general +3 oxidation state. The elements, in the first half of the series frequently exhibit higher oxidation states. For example, the maximum oxidation state increases from +4 in Th to +5, +6 and +7 respectively in Pa, U and Np but decreases in succeeding elements (Table 4.11). The actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in having more compounds in +3 state than in the +4 state. However, +3 and +4 ions tend to hydrolyse."}

The action of boiling water on them, for example, gives a mixture of oxide and hydride and combination with most non metals takes place at moderate temperatures. Hydrochloric acid attacks all metals but most are slightly affected by nitric acid owing to the formation of protective oxide layers; alkalies have no action. The magnetic properties of the actinoids are more complex than those of the lanthanoids. Although the variation in the magnetic susceptibility of the actinoids with the number of unpaired 5 f electrons is roughly parallel to the corresponding results for the lanthanoids, the latter have higher values. It is evident from the behaviour of the actinoids that the ionisation enthalpies of the early actinoids, though not accurately known, but are lower than for the early lanthanoids."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_12_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 169, "content": "This is quite reasonable since it is to be expected that when 5f orbitals are beginning to be occupied, they will penetrate less into the inner core of electrons. The 5f electrons, will therefore, be more effectively shielded from the nuclear charge than the 4f electrons of the corresponding lanthanoids. Because the outer electrons are less firmly held, they are available for bonding in the actinoids. A comparison of the actinoids with the lanthanoids, with respect to different characteristics as discussed above, reveals that behaviour similar to that of the lanthanoids is not evident until the second half of the actinoid series. However, even the early actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in showing close similarities with each other and in gradual variation in properties which do not entail change in oxidation state. The lanthanoid and actinoid contractions, have extended effects on the sizes, and therefore, the properties of the elements succeeding them in their respective periods. The lanthanoid contraction is more important because the chemistry of elements succeeding the actinoids are much less known at the present time. 4.7 4.7 4.7 4.7 4.7 Some Some Some Some Some Applications Applications Applications Applications Applications of d- and of d- and of d- and of d- and of d- and f-Block f-Block f-Block f-Block f-Block Elements Elements Elements Elements Elements Iron and steels are the most important construction materials.

TiCl4 with A1(CH3)3 forms the basis of the Ziegler catalysts used to manufacture polyethylene (polythene). Iron catalysts are used in the Haber process for the production of ammonia from N2/H2 mixtures. Nickel catalysts enable the hydrogenation of fats to proceed.

{"source": "chemistry_class_12_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 171, "content": "Their melting and boiling points are high which are attributed to the involvement of (n \u20131) d electrons resulting into strong interatomic bonding. In many of these properties, the maxima occur at about the middle of each series which indicates that one unpaired electron per d orbital is particularly a favourable configuration for strong interatomic interaction. Successive ionisation enthalpies do not increase as steeply as in the main group elements with increasing atomic number. Hence, the loss of variable number of electrons from (n \u20131) d orbitals is not energetically unfavourable. The involvement of (n\u20131) d electrons in the behaviour of transition elements impart certain distinct characteristics to these elements. Thus, in addition to variable oxidation states, they exhibit paramagnetic behaviour, catalytic properties and tendency for the formation of coloured ions, interstitial compounds and complexes. The transition elements vary widely in their chemical behaviour. Many of them are sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although a few are \u2018noble\u2019. Of the first series, with the exception of copper, all the metals are relatively reactive. The transition metals react with a number of non-metals like oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and halogens to form binary compounds. The first series transition metal oxides are generally formed from the reaction of metals with oxygen at high temperatures. These oxides dissolve in acids and bases to form oxometallic salts. Potassium dichromate and potassium permanganate are common examples. Potassium dichromate is prepared from the chromite ore by fusion with alkali in presence of air and acidifying the extract. Pyrolusite ore (MnO2) is used for the preparation of potassium permanganate. Both the dichromate and the permanganate ions are strong oxidising agents.

He prepared and characterised a large number of coordination compounds and studied their physical and chemical behaviour by simple experimental techniques. Werner proposed the concept of a primary valence and a secondary valence for a metal ion. Binary compounds such as CrCl3, CoCl2 or PdCl2 have primary valence of 3, 2 and 2 respectively.

Note that the last two compounds in Table 5.1 have identical empirical formula, CoCl3.4NH3, but distinct properties. Such compounds are termed as isomers. Werner in 1898, propounded his theory of coordination compounds. The main postulates are: 1. In coordination compounds metals show two types of linkages (valences)-primary and secondary. 2. The primary valences are normally ionisable and are satisfied by negative ions. 3. The secondary valences are non ionisable. These are satisfied by neutral molecules or negative ions. The secondary valence is equal to the coordination number and is fixed for a metal. 4.

In fact, Werner was the first to discover optical activity in certain coordination compounds. He, at the age of 29 years became a full professor at Technische Hochschule in Zurich in 1895. Alfred Werner was a chemist and educationist. His accomplishments included the development of the theory of coordination compounds. This theory, in which Werner proposed revolutionary ideas about how atoms and molecules are linked together, was formulated in a span of only three years, from 1890 to 1893.

These central atoms/ions are also referred to as Lewis acids. ( c ) Ligands The ions or molecules bound to the central atom/ion in the coordination entity are called ligands. These may be simple ions such as Cl \u2013, small molecules such as H2O or NH3, larger molecules such as H2NCH2CH2NH2 or N(CH2CH2NH2)3 or even macromolecules, such as proteins. When a ligand is bound to a metal ion through a single donor atom, as with Cl \u2013, H2O or NH3, the ligand is said to be unidentate. When a ligand can bind through two donor atoms as in H2NCH2CH2NH2 (ethane-1,2-diamine) or C2O4 2\u2013 (oxalate), the ligand is said to be didentate and when several donor atoms are present in a single ligand as in N(CH2CH2NH2)3, the ligand is said to be polydentate. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion (EDTA 4\u2013) is an important hexadentate ligand. It can bind through two nitrogen and four oxygen atoms to a central metal ion. When a di- or polydentate ligand uses its two or more donor atoms simultaneously to bind a single metal ion, it is said to be a chelate ligand. The number of such ligating groups is called the denticity of the ligand. Such complexes, called chelate complexes tend to be more stable than similar complexes containing unidentate ligands. Ligand which has two different donor atoms and either of the two ligetes in the complex is called ambidentate ligand. Examples of such ligands are the NO2 \u2013 and SCN \u2013 ions. NO2 \u2013 ion can coordinate either through nitrogen or through oxygen to a central metal atom/ion. Similarly, SCN \u2013 ion can coordinate through the sulphur or nitrogen atom."}

We shall focus our attention on elementary treatment of the application of VBT and CFT to coordination compounds. According to this theory, the metal atom or ion under the influence of ligands can use its (n-1)d, ns, np or ns, np, nd orbitals for hybridisation to yield a set of equivalent orbitals of definite geometry such as octahedral, tetrahedral, square planar and so on (Table 5.2).

For metal ions with upto three electrons in the d orbitals, like Ti 3+ (d 1); V 3+ (d 2); Cr 3+ (d 3); two vacant d orbitals are available for octahedral hybridisation with 4s and 4p orbitals. The magnetic behaviour of these free ions and their coordination entities is similar. When more than three 3d electrons are present, the required pair of 3d orbitals for octahedral hybridisation is not directly available (as a consequence of Hund\u2019s rule). Thus, for d 4 (Cr 2+, Mn 3+), d 5 (Mn 2+, Fe 3+), d 6 (Fe 2+, Co 3+) cases, a vacant pair of d orbitals results only by pairing of 3d electrons which leaves two, one and zero unpaired electrons, respectively. The magnetic data agree with maximum spin pairing in many cases, especially with coordination compounds containing d 6 ions. However, with species containing d 4 and d 5 ions there are complications.

{"source": "chemistry_class_12_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 196, "content": "The five d orbitals in an isolated gaseous metal atom/ion have same energy, i.e., they are degenerate. This degeneracy is maintained if a spherically symmetrical field of negative charges surrounds the metal atom/ion. However, when this negative field is due to ligands (either anions or the negative ends of dipolar molecules like NH3 and H2O) in a complex, it becomes asymmetrical and the degeneracy of the d orbitals is lifted. It results in splitting of the d orbitals. The pattern of splitting depends upon the nature of the crystal field. Let us explain this splitting in different crystal fields. ( a ) Crystal field splitting in octahedral coordination entities In an octahedral coordination entity with six ligands surrounding the metal atom/ion, there will be repulsion between the electrons in metal d orbitals and the electrons (or negative charges) of the ligands. Such a repulsion is more when the metal d orbital is directed towards the ligand than when it is away from the ligand. Thus, the 2 2 x y \uf02d d and 2 z d orbitals which point towards the axes along the direction of the ligand will experience more repulsion and will be raised in energy; and the dxy, dyz and dxz orbitals which are directed between the axes will be lowered in energy relative to the average energy in the spherical crystal field. Thus, the degeneracy of the d orbitals has been removed due to ligand electron-metal electron repulsions in the octahedral complex to yield three orbitals of lower energy, t2g set and two orbitals of higher energy, eg set."}

Thus, the energy of the two eg orbitals will increase by (3/5) Do and that of the three t2g will decrease by (2/5)Do. The crystal field splitting, Do, depends upon the field produced by the ligand and charge on the metal ion. Some ligands are able to produce strong fields in which case, the splitting will be large whereas others produce weak fields and consequently result in small splitting of d orbitals. In general, ligands can be arranged in a series in the order of increasing field strength as given below: I \u2013 < Br \u2013 < SCN \u2013 < Cl \u2013 < S 2\u2013 < F \u2013 < OH \u2013 < C2O4 2\u2013 < H2O < NCS \u2013 < edta 4\u2013 < NH3 < en < CN \u2013 < CO Such a series is termed as spectrochemical series. It is an experimentally determined series based on the absorption of light by complexes with different ligands. Let us assign electrons in the d orbitals of metal ion in octahedral coordination entities. Obviously, the single d electron occupies one of the lower energy t2g orbitals. In d 2 and d 3 coordination entities, the d electrons occupy the t2g orbitals singly in accordance with the Hund\u2019s rule. For d 4 ions, two possible patterns of electron distribution arise: (i) the fourth electron could either enter the t2g level and pair with an existing electron, or (ii) it could avoid paying the price of the pairing energy by occupying the eg level."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_12_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 198, "content": "Which of these possibilities occurs, depends on the relative magnitude of the crystal field splitting, Do and the pairing energy, P (P represents the energy required for electron pairing in a single orbital). The two options are: (i) If Do < P, the fourth electron enters one of the eg orbitals giving the configuration 3 1 2g g t e . Ligands for which Do < P are known as weak field ligands and form high spin complexes. (ii) If Do > P, it becomes more energetically favourable for the fourth electron to occupy a t2g orbital with configuration t2g 4eg 0.

The colour of the complex is complementary to that which is absorbed. The complementary colour is the colour generated from the wavelength left over; if green light is absorbed by the complex, it appears red.

Consider, for example, the complex [Ti(H2O)6] 3+, which is violet in colour. This is an octahedral complex where the single electron (Ti 3+ is a 3d 1 system) in the metal d orbital is in the t2g level in the ground state of the complex. The next higher state available for the electron is the empty eg level. If light corresponding to the energy of blue-green region is absorbed by the complex, it would excite the electron from t2g level to the eg level (t2g 1eg 0 \u00ae t2g 0eg 1). Consequently, the complex appears violet in colour (Fig. 5.10). The crystal field theory attributes the colour of the coordination compounds to d-d transition of the electron.

For example, removal of water from [Ti(H2O)6]Cl3 on heating renders it colourless. Similarly, anhydrous CuSO4 is white, but CuSO4.5H2O is blue in colour. The influence of the ligand on the colour of a complex may be illustrated by considering the [Ni(H2O)6] 2+ complex, which forms when nickel(II) chloride is dissolved in water.

The anionic ligands actually are found at the low end of the spectrochemical series. Further, it does not take into account the covalent character of bonding between the ligand and the central atom. These are some of the weaknesses of CFT, which are explained by ligand field theory (LFT) and molecular orbital theory which are beyond the scope of the present study. 5.5.6 Limitations of Crystal Field Theory The homoleptic carbonyls (compounds containing carbonyl ligands only) are formed by most of the transition metals.

These are described below: \u2022 Coordination compounds find use in many qualitative and quantitative chemical analysis.

{"source": "chemistry_class_12_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 204, "content": "During the last fifty years, advances in this area, have provided development of new concepts and models of bonding and molecular structure, novel breakthroughs in chemical industry and vital insights into the functioning of critical components of biological systems. The first systematic attempt at explaining the formation, reactions, structure and bonding of a coordination compound was made by A. Werner. His theory postulated the use of two types of linkages (primary and secondary) by a metal atom/ion in a coordination compound. In the modern language of chemistry these linkages are recognised as the ionisable (ionic) and non-ionisable (covalent) bonds, respectively. Using the property of isomerism, Werner predicted the geometrical shapes of a large number of coordination entities. The Valence Bond Theory (VBT) explains with reasonable success, the formation, magnetic behaviour and geometrical shapes of coordination compounds. It, however, fails to provide a quantitative interpretation of magnetic behaviour and has nothing to say about the optical properties of these compounds. The Crystal Field Theory (CFT) to coordination compounds is based on the effect of different crystal fields (provided by the ligands taken as point charges), For example, impure nickel is converted to [Ni(CO)4], which is decomposed to yield pure nickel. \u2022 Coordination compounds are of great importance in biological systems. The pigment responsible for photosynthesis, chlorophyll, is a coordination compound of magnesium. Haemoglobin, the red pigment of blood which acts as oxygen carrier is a coordination compound of iron. Vitamin B12, cyanocobalamine, the anti\u2013 pernicious anaemia factor, is a coordination compound of cobalt. Among the other compounds of biological importance with coordinated metal ions are the enzymes like, carboxypeptidase A and carbonic anhydrase (catalysts of biological systems). \u2022 Coordination compounds are used as catalysts for many industrial processes."}

{"source": "chemistry_class_12_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 218, "content": "For such calculations, logarithms are very useful. They help us in making difficult calculations easy. In Chemistry, logarithm values are required in solving problems of chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, electrochemistry, etc. We shall first introduce this concept, and discuss the laws, which will have to be followed in working with logarithms, and then apply this technique to a number of problems to show how it makes difficult calculations simple. We know that 23 = 8, 32 = 9, 53 = 125, 70 = 1 In general, for a positive real number a, and a rational number m, let am = b, where b is a real number. In other words the mth power of base a is b. Another way of stating the same fact is logarithm of b to base a is m. If for a positive real number a, a \u00b9 1 am = b, we say that m is the logarithm of b to the base a.

That is why logarithms are so useful in all numerical computations."}

If n is not an integral power of 10, then it is not easy to calculate log n. But mathematicians have made tables from which we can read off approximate value of the logarithm of any positive number between 1 and 10. And these are sufficient for us to calculate the logarithm of any number expressed in decimal form. For this purpose, we always express the given decimal as the product of an integral power of 10 and a number between 1 and 10. Standard Form of Decimal We can express any number in decimal form, as the product of (i) an integral power of 10, and (ii) a number between 1 and 10.

When log n has been expressed as p + log m, where p is an integer and 0 log m < 1, we say that p is the \u201ccharacteristic\u201d of log n and that log m is the \u201cmantissa of log n. Note that characteristic is always an integer \u2013 positive, negative or zero, and mantissa is never negative and is always less than 1. If we can find the characteristics and the mantissa of log n, we have to just add them to get log n. Thus to find log n, all we have to do is as follows: 1. Put n in the standard form, say n = m \u00d7 10 p, 1 < m <10 2. Read off the characteristic p of log n from this expression (exponent of 10). 3. Look up log m from tables, which is being explained below. 4.

This means that log (6.230) = 0.7945* But we want log (6.234). So our answer will be a little more than 0.7945. How much more? We look this up in the section on Mean differences."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_12_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 224, "content": "Since our fourth digit is 4, look under the column headed by 4 in the Mean difference section (in the row 62). We see the number 3 there. So add 3 to 7945. We get 7948. So we finally have log (6.234) = 0.7948. Take another example. To find log (8.127), we look in the row 81 under column 2, and we find 9096. We continue in the same row and see that the mean difference under 7 is 4. Adding this to 9096, and we get 9100. So, log (8.127) = 0.9100. Finding N when log N is given We have so far discussed the procedure for finding log n when a positive number n given. We now turn to its converse i.e., to find n when log n is given and give a method for this purpose. If log n = t, we sometimes say n = antilog t. Therefore our task is given t, find its antilog. For this, we use the ready- made antilog tables. Suppose log n = 2.5372. To find n, first take just the mantissa of log n. In this case it is .5372. (Make sure it is positive.) Now take up antilog of this number in the antilog table which is to be used exactly like the log table. In the antilog table, the entry under column 7 in the row .53 is 3443 and the mean difference for the last digit 2 in that row is 2, so the table gives 3445. Hence, antilog (.5372) = 3.445 Now since log n = 2.5372, the characteristic of log n is 2. So the standard form of n is given by n = 3.445 \u00d7 10 2 or n = 344.5 Illustration 1: If log x = 1.0712, find x."}
