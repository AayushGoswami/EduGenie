This again, is not just a textbook with facts \u2014 it is an invitation to question, to perform experiments, and to explore, as we try to understand the beautiful world we live in. The world of science covers everything \u2014 small and large, near and far. We may be looking at tiny cells inside a leaf, or the movement of the sun and the stars. We may be testing out the materials around us at home, or discussing how water \ufb02 ows underground. As you go through the chapters in this book, you will start new adventures that challenge your thinking, expand your knowledge, and help you become an explorer, making small discoveries for yourself. Before we dive into our exciting journey, take a moment to observe something special about this book. Look at the page numbers \u2014 they follow the playful \ufb02 ight of a butter\ufb02 y and the soaring of a paper plane! Just as a butter\ufb02 y \ufb02 utters freely and a paper plane \ufb02 ies into the sky, learning takes \ufb02 ight when curiosity leads the way. Did you know that something as simple as a paper plane inspired real scienti\ufb01 c explorations of \ufb02 ight? From early inventors studying bird wings to modern engineers designing aircraft, the dream of \ufb02 ying started with simple observations and experiments. So, as you turn each page, let your imagination take \ufb02 ight \u2014 exploring new ideas, discovering wonders, and reaching for the skies!"}

Science, as we said in Grade 6, is a process, so it is about a way of thinking that welcomes curiosity, asks questions, and is open to the unknown. In Grade 7, we will try to ask deeper questions: How do things work? Why do events happen the way they do? And what can we learn from the patterns that we see in nature? To do this, we have to step out of this book, step out of the classroom perhaps, and experience the world through activities and experiments. These are experiences that we hope will not just be interesting or exciting but also serve as stepping stones to a deeper understanding of the environment we live in and of our place on this planet. We believe that this will also help you to see science as an ongoing process of discovery. And not just about discovery alone, but also about responsibility. As young science explorers, you will soon see how human activities are linked to what happens in the natural world and are connected to the society we live in. You will, we hope, also see the role that science can play in addressing environmental challenges and help in creating a more sustainable world. But let\u2019s get back into this book for now. You will read about topics in di\ufb00 erent \ufb01 elds of science, from physics and chemistry to biology and earth sciences. While they might appear as di\ufb00 erent chapters, just as we had said in Grade 6, they are all interconnected."}

So, let\u2019s take a quick journey through our book for this year. We will start by looking at the properties of materials around us, mostly the things we experience but perhaps never ask questions about \u2014 why are some fruits sour? What happens when we wash a haldi stain on our school uniform? The Ever-Evolving World of Science 3 We then move on and play with some electric batteries, lamps and wires to try to \ufb01 nd other kinds of properties of materials. What kind of materials do we need to make a lamp glow? This will lead us to classifying materials based on their properties \u2014 and we will enter the world of metals and non-metals. We know from our experience that a torch battery runs out eventually, and can\u2019t be used again. We\u2019ll explore what kind of changes happen around us. Some changes can be reversed and others cannot be reversed. Batteries run out, ice melts into water, fruits ripen, rocks break into pebbles\u2026 what kind of changes are these? Some of these happen, or happen faster, when things are heated. We will look at how heat \ufb02 ows \u2014 whether it is the melting of an ice cube in a glass, or the melting of a glacier. Water is, of course, everywhere, and with the heat from the Sun, it evaporates from the seas and falls as rain, perhaps trickling down into the ground, somewhere far away.

Not just us humans, there are life processes that are essential to all animals for their survival. To grow, we have to eat and breathe, blood has to circulate the nutrients from the food all over the body and so on. But why animals alone? Don\u2019t plants also need food to grow? How do they get their food? Do they also breathe? How? Over the time that life has evolved on our planet Earth, it has \ufb01 gured out how to do this in a beautiful and carefully balanced way. Ah, but what is time? The clock on the wall or a wrist watch tells us the time and how it passes. We get prepared to go to school in the morning and are ready to sleep at night but have you thought about how we measure time? And how fast does something happen? Long before the age of electric clocks and digital watches, early humans observed the shadows of objects in the Sun and used the position of the shadows to tell the time. Light and shadows are not just useful for shadow puppets or to tell the time. Naturally, light helps us see and today, we\u2019ve developed a lot of ways to generate light (so we can read a book at night, even when the Sun doesn\u2019t shine). But, more importantly, asking questions about the nature The Ever-Evolving World of Science 5 of light has given us a very deep understanding of the universe we live in.

On 28 February, the school hosted a science fair to celebrate National Science Day. At the entry gate, siblings Ashwin and Keerthi were greeted with a white sheet of paper. They were curious to know why a white sheet of paper was given to them! A few steps ahead, there was a volunteer spraying a liquid on these sheets of paper. The siblings also got their white sheets sprayed. To their surprise, the words \u2018Welcome to the Wonderful World of Science\u2019 appeared on the papers the moment the liquid was sprayed (Fig. 2.1). They were excited and eager to know how this happened and the reason behind it. Their curiosity was partly satis\ufb01 ed at the \u2018Colourful World of Substances\u2019 stall.

When lime water is added to this test tube, the colour of the solution eventually changes from red to blue. This shows that the solution in the test tube is no longer acidic. Lime water has neutralised the e\ufb00 ect of the acid. When the solution of an acid is mixed with the solution of a base in su\ufb03 cient quantity, we \ufb01 nd that the resulting solution is neither acidic nor basic. Such reactions are called neutralisation reactions. In a neutralisation reaction, salt and water are formed with the evolution (i.e., release) of heat. Acid + Base \u2192Salt + Water + Heat There are many examples in everyday life where you can observe the use of neutralisation processes. Let us \ufb01 nd out! 2.3 Neutralisation in Daily Life y Situation 1: Keerthi was observing a butter\ufb02 y in the garden with her hand resting on a tree trunk. Suddenly, a red ant bit her, leaving her skin red with stinging pain (Fig. 2.11). Her brother helped her by applying moist baking soda to the a\ufb00 ected area, which relieved the pain. What do you think might be the reason for this? When an ant bites, it injects an acidic liquid (formic acid) into the skin. The e\ufb00 ect of the acid can be neutralised by rubbing moist baking soda, which is a base. What remedies do people use to treat ant bites in your region? Situation 2: On the Farmer\u2019s Portal (an online platform from the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare), a query from a farmer states, \u201cMy plants are not growing well lately\u201d."}

Organic matter releases acids that neutralise the basic nature of the soil. Sometimes, the soil may be neutral, but the plants growing in it may still show poor health, which can be due to the de\ufb01 ciency of nutrients in the soil. Situation 3: Ashwin\u2019s friend Gurbir stays near an industrial area. He shared with him that the \ufb01 sh population in his neighbourhood lake was declining day by day! What do you think might be the causes for this? It may be due to factory waste being released into the lake. If the factory waste is acidic in nature, what could be done to save the \ufb01 sh in the lake? The factory waste can be neutralised by adding basic substances before releasing into the lake. Let us wrap up! Now, can you explain why the words \u2018Welcome to the Wonderful World of Science\u2019 appeared on Ashwin and Keerthi\u2019s paper sheets when the liquid was sprayed on them?

This setup forms an electrical circuit, which provides a complete path for electric current to \ufb02 ow through the lamp. The lamp glows only when current passes through the circuit. The direction of electric current in an electrical circuit is taken to be from the positive to the negative terminal of the electric cell. When the terminals of the lamp are connected with those of the electric cell by wires, the current passes through the \ufb01 lament of the incandescent lamp and makes it glow. With an incandescent lamp, it does not matter which of its terminals connects to the positive or negative terminal of the cell. The lamp will glow as long as the circuit is complete and current \ufb02 ows through the \ufb01 lament. FASCINATING FACTS Sometimes, an incandescent lamp does not glow even when connected to a cell. We say the lamp has \u2018fused\u2019 usually due to a broken \ufb01 lament. A broken \ufb01 lament stops the \ufb02 ow of current, preventing the lamp from glowing.

This property by which materials can be beaten into thin sheets is called malleability. Most metals possess this property. Can you give some examples of metal sheets? You might have seen thin silver foil on some sweets and aluminium foil used for wrapping food items. These are formed due to their malleability. Gold and silver are the most malleable metals.

Metal wires play important functions in a variety of stringed musical instruments, such as veena, sitar, violin, and guitar. This property of materials by which they can be drawn into wires is called ductility. This property of ductility is mainly possessed by metals.

You may have noticed that the metal spoon is hotter to touch than the wooden spoon. Even though both spoons are immersed in the water of the same temperature and for the same time. This shows that the heat transfers through the metal spoon, making it hotter. In contrast, the wooden spoon transfers heat poorly. In such cases, the transfer of heat from one point to another of a material is called conduction, and materials that transfer heat are called conductors. Based on the observations, one can say that metals are good conductors of heat, whereas wood is a poor conductor of heat.

Materials that allow electricity to \ufb02 ow through them easily are called good conductors of electricity.

It is observed in glass bottles A and B that the iron nails do not show any brown deposits. What does this observation indicate? This indicates that brown deposits or discolouration on the iron nails do not develop when the iron nail is kept in dry air alone (bottle A) or water alone (bottle B). However, in glass bottle C, the iron nail shows the presence of brown deposits. This indicates that the presence of both water and air is essential for these deposits to develop. Thus, moist air is responsible for the development of brown deposits on objects made of iron. This brown deposit is called rust. The process of formation of rust on objects made of iron is called rusting. Many other metals also exhibit discolouration when kept open in the atmosphere. Have you noticed the formation of a green coating on the surface of copper objects or a black coating on the surface of silver objects? Gradual deterioration of metal surfaces caused by air, water, or other substances is known as corrosion. Do you know that rusting of iron is a serious problem in our country?

Straw Straw (a) A B (b) Glass tumbler containing tap water Glass tumbler containing lime water Fig. 5.2: Blowing air in (a) tap water; (b) lime water Do you notice any changes? In glass tumbler A, blowing air into water creates bubbles only, and there is no change in the appearance of the water. In glass tumbler B, blowing air into lime water creates bubbles, and turns the lime water milky (or cloudy). If we leave it for some time, a white substance settles at the bottom of the glass tumbler, indicating something new has formed. Such changes, in which one or more new substances are formed, are called chemical changes. New substances are formed through a process called chemical reaction. In this case, carbon dioxide from the air you breathe out (exhale) reacts with lime water, and forms a new white-coloured substance (calcium carbonate) that is insoluble in water. Therefore, the liquid in the bottle appears milky. Along with this a small amount of water is also formed. This formation of a new substance indicates a chemical change. The chemical reaction involved in this change can be represented in short form as a chemical equation.

Why does this happen? Since the candle covered by the glass tumbler does not have a continuous supply of air, the \ufb02 ame gets extinguished soon. The component of air that supports combustion is oxygen. This can be con\ufb01 rmed by the presence of carbon dioxide in the glass tumbler inverted on the candle.

After some time, the paper becomes so hot that it starts burning. This minimum temperature at which a substance catches \ufb01 re is called its ignition temperature. Since the temperature of the lighted matchstick was already higher than the ignition temperature of the paper, it caught \ufb01 re almost immediately.

Thus, changes around us could be grouped into those that can be reversed and those that cannot be reversed. 5.6 Are All Changes Desirable? g Many useful changes happen in our daily life. For example, the changing of milk into curd, ripening of fruits, cutting of fruits, and cooking of food. All these are desirable changes. Can you think of some other desirable changes happening around you? Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical 67 On the other hand, some changes may be undesirable, such as the rusting of iron or the decay of food during its storage. A change that is undesirable in some situations may be desirable in other situations. For example, decomposition of food can be very useful in converting food waste into compost. Some changes occurring over the years due to human activity can have a long-term environmental impact. For example, the increased consumption of fuels in cars, trains, aeroplanes, etc., is increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Drying of paint on walls, doors, furniture, etc., releases many substances through evaporation, causing atmospheric pollution. 5.7 Some Slow Natural Changes g 5.7.1 Weathering of rocks Have you seen heaps of sand, soil, and stones lying at the base of mountains as shown in Fig. 5.10a? These are called sediments. How have these formed? These are formed by physical changes that break up large rocks into smaller pieces. Temperature changes due to climatic conditions, growing roots of trees, and even freezing of water within cracks in the rocks can cause them to break. Water or chemicals present in water, can also react with the rocks and cause chemical changes in their composition."}
{"source": "science_class_7.pdf", "chunk_id": 61, "content": "An example of such a chemical change is shown in Fig. 5.10b. Here, an originally black-coloured rock called basalt, which contains iron, has chemically changed to produce a red-coloured layer. The red colour is a result of the iron oxide produced when the rock surface was exposed for a long time to water or air containing water vapour. These physical and chemical changes in rocks are collectively called weathering, which eventually leads to the formation of soil. (a) (b) Fig. 5.10: (a) Sediments at the base of a cliff (b) red sediment layer Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 68 5.7.2 Erosion Have you noticed \ufb01 ne sand collecting on riverbeds or in lakes? This sand is formed when rock pebbles, soil, and sediments are broken down and moved from one location to another by natural forces like wind and \ufb02 owing water. This process is called erosion. Erosion during a landslide is an example of a physical change. River rocks and pebbles often appear smoother due to the constant erosion caused by the \ufb02 owing water. When the speed of the water or wind decreases, such as in an ocean or a lake, the material transported during erosion settles down at the bottom. These sediments harden over time and become new rocks. Most of these changes take place over thousands of years and cannot be reversed. In a Nutshell \uf076A physical change is one in which a substance or object undergoes a change in its physical properties and no new substance is formed. \uf076A chemical change is one in which one or more new substances are formed. It involves a chemical reaction and can be represented by a chemical equation. \uf076Combustion, cooking, and rusting are examples of chemical changes. \uf076Substances that undergo combustion are combustible substances."}

From these seeds, new plants emerge. It is quite unlikely that a seedling will develop the capabilities to produce its own seeds immediately after germination. It needs to grow and reach maturity to become capable of producing seeds. Similarly, animals also need to grow and reach maturity before they can reproduce. Some animals lay eggs that hatch into young ones, while others, like humans, directly give birth to young ones. In both cases, the young ones gradually grow in size and develop over time. Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 74 The journey of life of a human can be divided into different stages\u2014infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age. Each person experiences these stages at their own pace, and the duration of each stage may vary from one individual to another. From infancy to adulthood, our bodies undergo various changes. Until around 10\u201312 years of age, most changes are related to height and weight. After this, other noticeable changes begin to occur, marking the onset of adolescence. This is a period of rapid growth and development, typically occurring between the ages of 10\u201319. During adolescence, the body prepares for adulthood. Humans, like most other living beings, can not reproduce immediately after their birth. Their bodies need to grow and reach a stage of maturity to be able to reproduce. As humans grow and develop, they experience significant physical, emotional, and behavioural changes, along with the ability to reproduce. Some of these changes may be quite clearly observable, while others occur internally and may go unnoticed."}

Girls also undergo changes in height and weight, and other body changes like development of breasts. Increase in height From birth, our body undergoes continuous growth and development including an increase in height. However, the increase in height becomes more prominent during adolescence. Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 76 Changes in voice In adolescent boys, the growth of the voice box leads to a voice that sounds hoarse. The voice box is a structure in our throat that helps us to speak. The growth may be seen as a bump in the throat region and is called the Adam\u2019s apple. However, it is not noticeable in every individual. The voice box also grows in adolescent girls but it is not as big as in the boys, leading to only slight changes in voice. Changes in facial skin: emergence of pimples Another common occurrence during the adolescent years is a skin condition called acne, in which small, reddish pimples appear. These are commonly visible on the face. Acne occurs due to an increase in oily secretions from the skin during adolescence that can clog the skin pores and lead to infections. While acne is a condition, pimples are a manifestation of it.

However, these characteristic changes help distinguish males from females. For this reason, they are called secondary sexual characteristics. Secondary sexual characteristics are natural signs that the body is preparing for adulthood. They mark the onset of puberty. Puberty is the stage in which the body of an adolescent undergoes external and internal changes to develop into an adult capable of reproduction. 6.2 Changes that Indicate Reproductive Capability Adolescence is marked not only by observable changes but also by internal changes that are not visible from the outside. One such change is the maturation of various parts involved in the process of reproduction. Both boys and girls experience such changes gradually, and these changes are a natural part of the process of growing up. An important internal change associated with adolescent girls is the onset of the menstrual cycle."}

Many healthy girls may have longer or shorter menstrual cycles ranging from 21\u201335 days. The menstrual cycle is an important natural process and is one of the signs of good reproductive health. The phase of the cycle when blood discharge occurs from the body is referred to as menstruation. It may last for three to seven days. Some girls may feel pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen during these days. Usually, by the age of 45\u201355, menstruation stops naturally, marking the end of the reproductive capability in a woman\u2019s life. Breaking myths about menstruation There are many wrong beliefs about menstruation that often lead to unnecessary fear, shame, or even guilt. These beliefs have given rise to certain myths and taboos. Among such myths and taboos, physical isolation of menstruating girls is unfortunately still quite prevalent. Menstruation is a natural process, and such myths have no scientific basis. By encouraging a scientific outlook towards menstruation, we can help society appreciate the need to promote good reproductive health of women and contribute positively towards a healthier lifestyle for women. Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 78 Adolescence is not just about physical changes or changes associated with reproductive capability but also about emotional and behavioural changes. Let us discuss them! 6.3 Emotional and Behavioural Changes in Adolescents Activity 6.2: Let us list Take a moment to think if there are any changes in your emotions or behaviour or that of your classmates and friends in the past one or two years. These changes may be exciting, confusing, or both. Let us list some emotional changes in Table 6.2 along with their probable effects on behaviour and ways for positive growth and development."}

This is because adolescence is often marked by stronger emotions than childhood. These emotions might affect adolescents\u2019 behaviour like taking up/joining social initiatives to support the needy and the disadvantaged, or developing deeper interest in new areas. Understanding how our emotions influence our behaviour and actions, can help us make better choices and respond to situations thoughtfully. Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change 79 6.4 Making Adolescence a Joyful Experience The journey of adolescence is a unique experience. Heightened curiosity and excitement during this stage of life give adolescents a new viewpoint towards almost everything around them. Good habits, thoughtful decisions, and small actions can have a powerful positive impact on the overall well-being of adolescents. Let us know about them! 6.4.1 Meeting nutritional needs In Grade 6 chapter \u2018Mindful Eating: A Path to a Healthy Body\u2019, you learnt about the need for a healthy diet. Since adolescence is a period of growth and development marked by several changes in the body, a nutritious diet is of utmost importance. For proper growth, and to perform well on the playground, we need proteins and carbohydrates! Not only that, we also need an adequate amount of fats, vitamins, and minerals as well!"}

Discuss the sources of vitamin B12 with your teacher. 6.4.2 Personal hygiene Besides nutrition, personal hygiene is also crucially important during adolescence. Maintaining body hygiene, particularly in the armpits and the pubic region, may protect us from potential infections. For girls, maintaining proper hygiene during menstruation is essential for both comfort and health."}
{"source": "science_class_7.pdf", "chunk_id": 73, "content": "Menstrual hygiene can be maintained using items such as sanitary pads (Fig. 6.1) and reusable cloth pads designed for this purpose. The government also attempts to provide these products free of charge or at a low price to improve the menstrual hygiene of girls and women. As a society, we should all make efforts to ensure the availability of necessary facilities in schools and public places to promote menstrual hygiene. Collectively, we should move forward, reducing any stigma around sanitary pads and helping in menstrual hygiene. It is important to dispose of used sanitary pads properly by wrapping them in newspaper and disposing inside a dustbin. This is to ensure community health and environmental cleanliness. These days, biodegradable sanitary pads are also available that are environment-friendly. Fig. 6.1: Sanitary pad Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change 81 Science and Society To support menstrual hygiene, the government has introduced several initiatives\u2014 \u0099 Menstrual Hygiene Scheme (MHS): Under this scheme by the Government of India, sanitary pads are provided free of charge or at a reduced price to adolescent girls in rural areas.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 82 6.4.4 Balanced social life We all live in a society and interact with each other in our day-to-day life. We should all be polite and respectful towards each other (Fig. 6.3). This helps create a favourable and safe environment. Since adolescence is a stage of life marked by new experiences and emotions, we must be thoughtful and responsible while interacting with others \u2014 whether in person or through social media. This is the time adolescents may feel attracted to their peers, and mimic their behaviour. Today, they often interact with each other online.

We now understand the different changes in adolescence and also know some ways to handle it with a sense of responsibility. Many changes in adolescence, including menstruation and other signs of puberty, are mainly due to hormones \u2014 certain chemicals produced in our bodies. Hormones play a crucial role in regulating various aspects of growth and development, contributing to the proper functioning of the body. They are produced in different parts of the body and are released at an appropriate time in response to signals from the brain. Some hormones influence mood and behaviour."}

Why did all the pins not fall together? From your observations, what can you infer? Do you think that heat is being transferred along the metal strip from the end that is being heated? As the heat travels along the strip and approaches a pin, the wax holding it melts and the pin falls. Here, the transfer of heat takes place from the hot end of the strip to the colder end. The process of heat transfer from the hotter part of an object to the colder part is called conduction."}

However, the particles themselves do not move from their positions. Materials like metals that allow heat to pass through them easily are called good conductors of heat. Because metals are good conductors of heat, we use utensils made of metals for cooking. In solids, heat transfer takes place mainly through the process of conduction. If we use a strip made of a material like wood or glass in place of a metal strip to perform Activity 7.1, the pins will not fall. Can you think of the reason for this based on our learning from the chapter \u2018The World of Metals and Non-Metals\u2019?

The water on the sides of the beaker is comparatively cooler and heavier, and comes down to take the place of the rising water. Then, this water gets heated and in turn also rises. This cycle continues until the entire volume of water gets heated. In this case, the entire volume of water gets heated through the actual movement of water particles. This process of heat transfer is known as convection. It is because of convection that we see the movement of the coloured streak inside the beaker.

Thus, people living near the seashore experience that the direction of the wind reverses in the day and night. 7.3 Radiation Do you remember when Pema and Palden were sitting around the \ufb01 replace?

The heat of the Sun reaches us through this process. Heat transfer by radiation does not require any medium. All objects radiate heat. You must have observed that a hot utensil kept away from the \ufb02 ame cools down after some time. What is the reason for it? The hot utensil cools down by radiating heat to its surroundings. Why is it more comfortable to wear white or light-coloured clothes during summers and dark-coloured clothes during winters? Light-coloured clothes re\ufb02 ect most of the heat that falls on them, and therefore, we feel more comfortable wearing them during summers.

These are conduction, convection, and radiation. \uf076In conduction, heating takes place when one particle receives heat, transfers heat to the next particle in contact, and so on. The particles themselves do not move away from their positions. \uf076In convection, heat transfer takes place by the actual movement of particles. \uf076Note that in conduction and convection, a medium must be present whose particles help in the transfer of heat. \uf076In the case of radiation, heat travels from one place to another and no material medium is required for its transfer. FASCINATING FACTS In the upper reaches of the Himalayan region, a traditional room heater locally known as bukhari is used to keep rooms warm during winters. It consists of an iron stove in which wood or charcoal is burnt. A long pipe attached to the upper part of the heater serves as a chimney, venting out the smoke. Additionally, the bukhari can be used for cooking, as its \ufb02 at top provides a platform for placing utensils.

Let us look at the phenomenon of water cycle to understand this in more detail. 7.4 Water Cycle y You have also learnt in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, that water exists in three states in nature. As a liquid, it \ufb01 lls the oceans, rivers, and lakes on the Earth. As a solid, it forms snow, ice sheets, and glaciers in the mountains and the polar regions. As a gas, it exists in the form of water vapour in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. During summers, some of the snow and ice gets converted to water due to the Sun\u2019s radiation and \ufb02 ows down as rivers, and ultimately into the oceans. The melted ice is replenished by fresh snow during winters. Water in the oceans, rivers, and lakes gets heated due to the Sun, and as a result, it evaporates as water vapour. Water also evaporates from trees and plants through transpiration. When water vapour rises up, it cools down and condenses to form clouds. Clouds bring rain, snow, and hail. This process is called precipitation. The continuous movement of water \u2014 upward as water vapour and downward through precipitation, passing through soil, rocks, and plants, and \ufb01 nally returning to water bodies, is called water cycle (Fig. 7.9). Thus, the water cycle helps in redistributing and replenishing water in rivers, lakes, and oceans. It also serves to conserve the total amount of water on the Earth. Rainwater that falls on the surface of the Earth, \ufb02 ows into ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans or seeps into the ground. Fig."}

You may have observed that water seeps fastest through gravel, slower through sand, and slowest through clay. Why is it so? The spaces between gravel particles are wider when compared to those in sand and clay. Hence, water can seep through the gravel more easily. In this way, water seeps beneath the surface of the Earth. This process of surface water seeping through soil and rocks is called in\ufb01 ltration. Water can in\ufb01 ltrate more readily if the spaces between soil and rock particles are wider, open, and interconnected (Fig. 7.11). The water that seeps through gets stored in the pore spaces of sediments and the openings in rocks beneath the surface as groundwater. The underground layers of sediments and rocks that store water in pore spaces are called aquifers (Fig. 7.12). This is the water we extract by digging wells or drilling bore wells into aquifers. This water may be a few metres to hundreds of metres below the ground, depending on the location. Fig. 7.12: Aquifer Rain In\ufb01 ltration Well Aquifer However, groundwater is not unlimited. The growing water requirements of an increasing population have led to excessive groundwater extraction. Additionally, decreased vegetation cover and increased concrete surfaces in urban areas have limited water in\ufb01 ltration. As a result, groundwater is getting depleted. To address this, rainwater harvesting and recharge pits are used to replenish groundwater. Hence, the water cycle ensures that groundwater sources are recharged, thereby helping to ensure a sustainable groundwater supply. Fig."}

For example, in Ladakh, people have developed innovative ways to conserve water by making ice stupas (Fig. 7.13) during the winters. SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Ice Stupa During the spring season in Ladakh, streams often dry up, leading to scarcity of water as the heat from the Sun\u2019s radiation is not enough to melt the snow on the mountains. During winters, water from mountain streams is channeled down through underground pipes. This water is then sprayed into the cold air. As it falls, it freezes due to extremely low temperatures. The ice builds up layer by layer, creating a tall, cone-shaped structure called an ice stupa as shown in Fig. 7.13. The ice stupa melts slowly during spring, providing water for farming and other needs throughout the summer. Fig. 7.13: Ice stupa In a Nutshell \uf076There are three ways in which heat is transferred from one place to another \u2014 conduction, convection, and radiation. \uf076The process of heat transfer from the hotter part of an object to a colder part is called conduction.

They started noticing that many events in nature repeat themselves after de\ufb01 nite intervals of time. For example, the rising and setting of the Sun, the phases of the Moon and the changing seasons. They started using the cycles of these events for timekeeping. First, they devised calendars. A day was de\ufb01 ned by the cycle of rising and setting of the Sun. Then began the quest to \ufb01 nd ways of knowing the time of day. How was time measured when there were no clocks and watches? So, they made many devices which helped them to measure smaller intervals of time within a day. Some of these were sundials, water clocks, hourglasses, and candle clocks. In a sundial, time is determined with the changing position of the shadow of an object cast by the light of the Sun during the day (Fig. 8.1). The water clocks used the \ufb02 ow of water out or into a vessel to measure time. In one type, water \ufb02 owed out from a vessel which had markings for time (Fig. 8.2a).

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 108 FASCINATING FACTS In ancient India, time was measured using both shadows and water clocks. The earliest reference to shadow-based time measurement appears in the Arthasastra by Kautilya (was composed and revised between the second century BCE \u2013 third century CE). An accurate expression for time in terms of the shadow of a vertical stick was given by Varahamihira around 530 CE. The water clock with water \ufb02 owing out was described in the Arthasastra, Sardulakarnavadana, and some other texts (early CE centuries). These clocks were not very accurate because as water levels dropped, the \ufb02 ow rate decreased. This led to the development of the sinking bowl water clock (Fig. 8.2b), or Ghatika-yantra, \ufb01 rst mentioned by Aryabhata, and then in several astronomical texts later. Time was measured constantly with Ghatika-yantra at Buddhist monasteries, royal palaces, town squares, and each time the bowl sank, it was announced by drums, conch shells, or striking a gong. Though the Ghatika-yantra was progressively replaced by pendulum clocks in the late nineteenth century, it continued to be used at the religious places for rituals. n y n , s h Fig. 8.6: Huygens\u2019 Pendulum clock Pendulum As human civilisation advanced, and as people began to travel long distances, the measurement of time became very critical.

He was inspired by the investigations of pendulums by Galileo Galilei (1564 \u20131642). It is said that once while sitting in a church, Galileo\u2019s attention was drawn to a lamp suspended from the ceiling, which was swinging back and forth. Using his pulse to measure time, Galileo found that the lamp took the same time for each swing.

The distances moved by objects in a given interval of time decide which one is faster or slower. We often say that the faster runner has a higher speed. You are probably familiar with the word \u2018speed\u2019. 8.3 Speed p By comparing the distances moved by two or more objects in a unit time, it can be found out which of them is moving faster. The unit time may be one second or one minute or one hour. We call the distance covered by an object in a unit time as the speed of the object. How can we determine the speed of an object? It can be calculated, if we know the total distance covered by an object and the time taken to cover it. The speed of an object is the total distance covered divided by the total time taken to cover it. Thus, Speed = Total distance covered Total time taken What would be the unit of speed? We know the SI units of length and time. Since the speed is distance/time, the SI unit of speed is metre/second and is expressed as m/s. Speed can also be expressed in other units. If we express the distance in kilometre and time in hour, then the unit of speed is kilometre/hour, expressed as km/h.

When an object moves along a straight line, its motion is called linear motion. Now, imagine a train on a track which is along a straight line between two adjacent railway stations. So, the motion of the train between these two stations is an example of linear motion (Fig. 8.11). The train starts from the \ufb01 rst station A at a slow speed, then moves at a faster speed, then slows down and comes to a halt at the next station D. In between the two stations, for some distance (B to C), the train moves at a constant speed, that is, at an unchanging speed.

These are collectively called life processes. In this chapter, we will learn about life processes such as nutrition and respiration in detail. Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 122 Observe your surroundings and notice what animals eat. Animals eat di\ufb00 erent types of food. Bees and sunbirds suck the nectar of \ufb02 owers, while infants of humans and many other animals feed on their mother\u2019s milk. Snakes, like python, swallow the animals they prey upon. Some aquatic animals \ufb01 lter tiny food particles \ufb02 oating nearby and feed upon them. Animals, including humans, obtain energy from food, which enables them to carry out various life processes. Animals consume food that contains complex components, such as carbohydrate, protein, and fat. These complex food components have to be broken down into simpler forms before the body can use them. But how does this process happen? Breaking down of complex food components into simpler forms occurs in a long tube called the alimentary canal. This process starts in the mouth and ends at the anus (Fig. 9.1). As food moves through this canal, digestive juices secreted at di\ufb00 erent parts break it down into simpler forms. This simpler form of food is absorbed by di\ufb00 erent parts of our alimentary canal and transported to various parts of our body to carry out various functions. 9.1 Nutrition in Animals How do the complex food components get broken down into simpler forms and used by the body in various animals?"}

Let us \ufb01 rst try to understand this process in humans. 9.1.1 Digestion in human beings Let us trace the journey of food inside our body as it passes through di\ufb00 erent parts of the alimentary canal. Beginning with the mouth cavity The journey of the food you eat begins when it enters your mouth. Your teeth break down food you eat into smaller pieces by the processes of crushing and chewing. This process of initial breakdown of food into \ufb01 ne pieces is called mechanical digestion. Think about your favourite food. Does your mouth feel watery? Fig. 9.1: Human digestive system Stomach Oesophagus or Food pipe Liver Pancreas Large intestine Anus Mouth Small intestine Rectum Life Processes in Animals 123 This happens because of more saliva that gets released when you recall your favourite food.

Take a small piece of chapati or a bite-sized portion of boiled rice and chew it properly for 30\u201360 seconds. At \ufb01 rst, the chapati or rice has its usual taste, but as you continue chewing, do you notice a change in taste? The food begins to taste sweet! Have you ever wondered why this happens? Chapati or rice contains starch, which is a type of carbohydrate. Our saliva contains a digestive juice that helps break down starch into sugar. This explains why starchy food, like chapati, tastes sweet when you chew it for a long time. Saliva helps to break down components of food into simpler ones.

This process of breaking complex food components into simpler forms in the body is called digestion. Food is partially digested in the mouth. Let us learn how this partially digested food gets further digested through the alimentary canal. Food pipe (Oesophagus): A passage from the mouth to the stomach When you chew your food, your saliva not only helps in digesting the starch but also moistens it, making it soft and easy to swallow. Your tongue helps in mixing chewed food with saliva and pushing this softened food into a long, \ufb02 exible tube called the food pipe or oesophagus (Fig. 9.2). But how does the food move down? The walls of the food pipe gently contract and relax in a wave-like motion to push the food down into the stomach. This movement takes place throughout the alimentary canal and pushes the food forward. Stomach In the stomach, the walls contract and relax to churn the food. The churned food is then mixed with a secretion from the inner lining of the stomach. The secretion from stomach contains digestive juice, acid, and mucus. Fig."}

In the stomach, the food is partially digested and transformed into a semi-liquid mass, preparing it for the next stage of digestion. Fig. 9.3: Stomach Digestive juice, acid and mucus Stomach wall FASCINATING FACTS How did scientists learn about digestion in the human body? The discovery of how the stomach works happened by chance. In 1822, a man named Alexis St. Martin was accidentally shot in the stomach. He was treated by a doctor, William Beaumont. However, his wound never fully healed, leaving a small permanent hole.

He conducted experiments on how di\ufb00 erent foods were broken down and studied how emotions a\ufb00 ect digestion.

It is a sketch of a stretched-out alimentary canal. Guess how long it is. You will be surprised that although it is called small intestine, it is almost 6 metres long\u2014almost twice the height of your classroom! You will be surprised to know that the small intestine is the longest part of the alimentary canal. The small intestine receives digestive secretions from three sources\u2014the inner lining of the small intestine itself, and two more structures associated with the alimentary canal\u2014the liver and the pancreas (Fig. 9.4)."}

Recall the neutralisation reaction in chapter \u2018Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral\u2019.

Stomach Mouth Food pipe (Oesophagus) Pancreas Small intestine Liver Large intestine Anus Fig. 9.4: Alimentary canal if it is stretched out Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 126 The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice, which is also basic in nature and helps neutralise acids present in the food. Additionally, pancreatic juice also breaks down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The digestive juice secreted by the wall of the small intestine further breaks down fats, proteins, and partially digested carbohydrates into simpler forms. The digested nutrients pass on from the small intestine into the blood present in blood vessels found in the walls of the small intestine. This process is called absorption of nutrients. How are these nutrients absorbed from the small intestine? The inner lining of the small intestine is thin and has thousands of \ufb01 nger-like projections (Fig. 9.5) that increase the surface area for e\ufb03 cient nutrient absorption. These \ufb01 nger-like projections allow the digested nutrients to pass into the blood, which carries them to di\ufb00 erent parts of the body. These nutrients provide energy, support growth and repair, and help the body function properly. Fig. 9.5: Inner lining of the small intestine 0.5 mm Large intestine After most of the nutrients are digested and absorbed in the small intestine, what happens to the undigested food?

The only way to manage celiac disease is to avoid foods that contain gluten. Millets (like jowar, bajra, and ragi) are good alternatives because they are naturally gluten-free. Life Processes in Animals 127 small intestine. The large intestine absorbs water and some salts from the undigested food, thus making the waste semi-solid. This semi-solid waste is called stool. The stool is then stored in the lower part of the large intestine, called the rectum, until the body is ready to get rid of it. Eating \ufb01 bre-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains helps the large intestine function properly by making the stool easier to pass. Finally, it is expelled through the anus\u2014a process known as egestion. This is how your body removes the waste it does not need, keeping you healthy! Isn\u2019t it fascinating how the digestive system works, absorbing nutrients from food and eliminating waste? FASCINATING FACTS The large intestine contains various small living organisms, such as bacteria, that help in digestion. They help in keeping our digestive system healthy.

I have seen cows keep chewing the food even when they are not actively grazing or eating anything. Why? Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 128 Grass-eating animals, such as cows (Fig. 9.6) and bu\ufb00 aloes, partially chew the grass and swallow it into their stomachs. In the stomach, partial digestion of the food takes place. The partially digested food is brought back to the mouth for gradual chewing. This process is called rumination, and these animals are called ruminants. A cow spends about 8 hours a day just chewing the food! The thoroughly chewed food again passes down the alimentary canal for further digestion. Fig. 9.6: Digestive system of a ruminant Oesophagus Small Intestine Rumen Pancreas Fig. 9.7: Digestive system in birds Fig 9 7: Digestive system in b Gizzard Intestine Stomach Oesophagus Birds do not have teeth, but they have a chamber called a gizzard (Fig. 9.7). Food is broken down by the contraction and relaxation of the walls of the gizzard, often with the help of grit (small stones) that the birds swallow. This shows that animals exhibit variations in the structure and function of the alimentary canal to adapt to di\ufb00 erent ways of digesting di\ufb00 erent kinds of food.

Is the process of respiration the same in all animals? Let us \ufb01 rst understand the process of respiration in humans. Life Processes in Animals 129 9.2.1 Respiration in humans You know that we breathe in (inhale) and breathe out (exhale) air continuously to obtain oxygen and release carbon dioxide. How is this oxygen used in the body? Are breathing and respiration di\ufb00 erent? Let us \ufb01 nd out. How do we breathe? The process of inhaling and exhaling air is called breathing. It is di\ufb03 cult to live without food for a week; without water for a day or two, but without breathing, we usually cannot survive more than a few minutes. Why is that? All of us are alive because we breathe. Not just humans, plants and other animals also breathe. But how do we breathe? Just as food follows a speci\ufb01 c pathway in the digestive system, our body also has a speci\ufb01 c system for breathing and respiration. This system is called respiratory system. The respiratory system consists of various parts as shown in Fig. 9.8. In this system, the exchange of gases follows a speci\ufb01 c pathway.

These hair, along with mucus, help trap dust and dirt from the air we breathe in. This is why we should breathe through the nose and not through the mouth. From the nasal passages, the air reaches our lungs through the windpipe. The windpipe forms two branches, which enter the two lungs. In the lungs, these branches further divide into smaller and \ufb01 ner branches that end in small balloon-like sacs called alveoli (Fig. 9.8). Our lungs are protected by the rib cage.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Breathing Practices for a Healthy Life Breathing exercises have been practised across di\ufb00 erent cultures in India and worldwide for centuries. Pranayama is well known for improving respiratory health, mind relaxation, and concentration. In Ladakh, people practise Tummo breathing, a technique that improves lung function and helps keep the body warm even in cold weather. Similarly, deep breathing techniques are used to promote well-being. Some traditions combine deep breathing with chanting, using rhythmic breath control to enhance relaxation and mental clarity. Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 132 How does the exchange of gases happen? Through the process of breathing, fresh air from outside enters the lungs and \ufb01 lls the alveoli. The alveoli have thin walls surrounded by \ufb01 ne tubes containing blood (Fig. 9.12). Blood carries carbon dioxide from the body to the alveoli, where it is released into the air."}
{"source": "science_class_7.pdf", "chunk_id": 126, "content": "At the same time, oxygen from the alveoli passes into the blood and is transported to all parts of the body. Have you ever wondered how the food you eat gives you energy? The key is not only the food but also the oxygen we breathe! When we eat food, our body breaks it down into simple substances like sugar (glucose). Oxygen helps break down glucose to release energy. This process is called respiration. The word equation of the process of respiration is as follows\u2014 Glucose + Oxygen Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy During breathing, we inhale air from our surroundings and exhale air having more carbon dioxide than the inhaled air. Note that not all the oxygen is used up (Fig. 9.13). Some other animals can use a larger fraction of the oxygen during respiration. This exchange of gases ensures that each segment of our body gets oxygen to produce energy and remove waste products. In simple words, breathing brings in oxygen and removes carbon dioxide, while respiration uses oxygen to break down food and release energy. This energy helps us walk, run, play, and even think! Breathing is a physical process, while respiration is a chemical process that occurs inside the body. Both the processes are essential for our survival!

It damages the lungs and increases the risk of serious diseases, including lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses. It leads to persistent coughing and frequent infections. In addition to harming the smoker, smoking releases toxic chemicals into the air, putting others at risk. When non-smokers inhale this polluted air, they experience passive smoking, which can be especially dangerous for children, pregnant women, and the elderly. Due to these risks, avoiding smoking helps protect both personal health and the well-being of those around us. 9.2.2 Do other animals breathe the same way as humans do? You have learnt that di\ufb00 erent animals live in di\ufb00 erent habitats. You may have observed birds \ufb02 ying and \ufb01 sh swimming. How do they breathe? Animals, such as birds, elephants, lions, cows, goats, lizards, and snakes, breathe through their lungs. Although all these animals have lungs, the structure of their lungs are quite di\ufb00 erent. Most aquatic animals like \ufb01 sh, have specialised structures known as gills (Fig. 9.14). These are richly supplied with blood vessels. The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the gases dissolved in water takes place across the gills. Amphibians, like frogs, live both on land and in water. They use di\ufb00 erent body parts for breathing at various stages of their life. For example, tadpoles breathe through gills, while adult frogs use lungs for breathing on land and skin for gas exchange when they stay in water."}

You will study about them in higher grades. In a Nutshell \uf076Life processes such as nutrition, circulation, respiration, excretion, and reproduction are essential for the survival of living beings. These processes are collectively called life processes. \uf076The human digestive system consists of an alimentary canal which includes the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anus, and its associated parts, the liver and the pancreas. \uf076The digested food is primarily absorbed through the walls of the small intestine. \uf076The nutrients absorbed are distributed through the blood to di\ufb00 erent parts of the body where they are used for performing various functions. \uf076The large intestine absorbs most of the remaining water and some salts from the undigested food. \uf076Grass-eating animals such as cows and goats are called ruminants. They chew the food partially and swallow it. Later, the partially digested food is returned to the mouth, and the animal chews it thoroughly. \uf076Breathing involves the movement of air into the lungs (inhalation) and out of the lungs (exhalation). \uf076The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs in the alveoli of the lungs. \uf076Respiration uses oxygen from inhaled air to break down glucose into carbon dioxide and water."}

We know that animals get their food from plants, either directly by eating plants or indirectly by eating animals that in turn eat plants for their nutrition and growth. But how do plants obtain the food they need to grow? Unlike animals, plants do not eat food. 10.2.1 Leaves: the \u0312 food factories\u0313 of plants Plants store food in the form of starch, a type of carbohydrate. This starch is produced in the leaves of a plant which, by design, are generally broad and \ufb02 at.

Do other green parts of the plant also perform photosynthesis? Yes, other parts of the plants which have chlorophyll also perform photosynthesis. So far, we have learnt that plants take in carbon dioxide from the air and water, and use sunlight to prepare their food by the process of photosynthesis.

Plants use water in the process of photosynthesis. Water, along with minerals present in the soil, is taken up by the roots of a plant. Minerals are important nutrients for the growth of plants. How do water and minerals taken up by the roots move to all parts of the plant? We can study water transport in plants by carrying out an activity. For this activity, we require two glass tumblers, some water, red ink, and twigs of two similar tender plants, preferably with white-coloured \ufb02 owers (for example, white sadabahar, balsam), as shown in Fig. 10.7.

Observe the cut stem using a magnifying glass. Do you spot the red colour in the stem (Fig. 10.7e)? How does the red colour ink move upwards? This is due to the thin tube-like structure called the xylem present in the stem, branches, and leaves of plants. Just like red ink, minerals dissolved in water also move up the stem through the xylem. Now, we know that water and minerals are transported to the leaves and other parts of plants through the xylem (Fig. 10.8). The water transported through the xylem is used to perform various functions. How does food get transported to other parts of a plant? 10.3.2 Transport of food We know that leaves are the primary site for photosynthesis. The food prepared by plants in the leaves is transported to all parts of the plant. This food is transported through another set of thin tube-like structures called the phloem (Fig. 10.8). The transported food may also be stored in some other parts of a plant, such as seeds and roots.

Compare both the test tubes for any change in colour. Does the lime water turn milky in both the test tubes? Why does the lime water turn milky in the test tube connected to the \ufb02 ask? Lime water turns milky due to the presence of more carbon dioxide in the \ufb02 ask. But where does this carbon dioxide come from? As we know, carbon dioxide is naturally present in very small quantities in the air. In the \ufb02 ask, additional carbon dioxide is produced by the seeds as they respire."}

Could the light from the Sun get blocked by the two planets which are revolving between the Earth and the Sun? The planets Mercury and Venus appear very small compared to the Sun, and never block the entire light from the Sun reaching us. However, you may be surprised to know that the Moon can do that. Do you remember studying in Grade 6 that the Moon is a natural satellite of the Earth and it revolves around the Earth as the Earth revolves around the Sun?"}

This is known as a solar eclipse. You may wonder how the Moon, which is smaller than the Sun, blocks the light coming from the Sun that we see in the sky. Activity 12.4: Let us explore \uf076Ask your friend to stand in front of you at a distance of about 5 metres. Consider his head to be the Sun. \uf076Now close one eye and show a thumbs up with your outstretched hand towards your friend as shown in Fig. 12.12. Are you able to cover the entire head of your friend with your thumb? You can cover the entire head of your friend with the help of your thumb, even though your thumb is much smaller than the actual size of your friend\u2019s head. How could it be? The size of any object as seen by your eye \u2014 also known as apparent size \u2014 depends upon both its actual physical size and its distance from you. The thumb being much closer to you as compared to your friend, the apparent sizes of your thumb and your friend\u2019s head as seen by you in Activity 12.4 are similar. The apparent sizes of the Moon and the Sun in the sky are similar when viewed from the Earth. This is so because though the Moon is much smaller in physical size than the Sun, the Moon is much closer to us compared to the Sun. Therefore, the Moon can appear to cover the entire Sun as viewed from the Earth."}

Thus, their apparent sizes are very much smaller than the Sun and they cannot block the Sun. For example, when Venus passes between the Sun and the Earth, it appears as a tiny black dot passing against the bright face of the Sun. This event, known as a Transit of Venus, is a rare event.

During a total solar eclipse, for a few minutes it turns dark during the day as no sunlight reaches the Earth. Due to the Earth\u2019s rotation and the motion of the Moon in its orbit, the Moon\u2019s shadow moves across the surface of the Earth. Thus, the total solar eclipse is visible only for a few minutes."}

Safe Viewing of a Solar Eclipse Caution\u2014 During a solar eclipse, one might be tempted to look at the Sun, thinking that it wouldn\u2019t be strong enough to cause harm to our eyes. However, even during the eclipse, the Sun is intense enough to damage the eyes and cause blindness. Thus, directly viewing solar eclipse must be strictly avoided. Also, do not view it through sunglasses, binoculars, or telescopes. Usually, astronomy organisations, such as planetaria and astronomy clubs hold eclipse viewing events during a solar eclipse (Fig. 12.15). Participating in such events is the best way to observe a solar eclipse since the organisers not only provide specialised eye protection for solar viewing, but also o\ufb00 er scienti\ufb01 c explanations.

A mirror can be used to project an image of the Sun onto a wall. However, holding it at the correct angle throughout a solar eclipse can be di\ufb03 cult. To solve this, make a movable stand for the mirror. Use a hollow ball with a small hole, half-\ufb01 ll it with sand (to keep it stable), and attach a small mirror (such as an embroidery mirror) to it."}

When the reasons for eclipses were not known, they feared the occurrence of eclipses. As you can imagine, something blocking the Sun, the main source of heat and light on the Earth, even for a brief period of time, would have been extremely concerning. Many superstitions were attached to solar eclipses in various parts of the world related to the activities that could not be carried out during eclipses\u2014such as eating, cooking, or going out of home. But now that we know the reason why a solar eclipse occurs, we need not fear these events as long as we do not look at the Sun directly. In fact, scientists go around the world to observe the eclipses from wherever these are observable. The eclipses provide them an opportunity to study phenomena that cannot be observed otherwise. FASCINATING FACTS An eclipse is known as grahan in Sanskrit and in many Indian languages. Many ancient Indian astronomical texts provide calculations to predict eclipses. The best known and most referred text is the Surya Siddhanta, which is written in the classical Sanskrit poetry tradition in rhythmic shlokas. 12.3.2 Lunar eclipse As the Moon revolves around the Earth, sometimes the Earth can block the sunlight from reaching the Moon."}

In a Nutshell \uf076The Earth rotates on its own axis in about 24 hours. \uf076The Earth\u2019s rotation from West to East causes day and night as well as the apparent motion of the Sun, the Moon, and the stars. \uf076The Earth revolves around the Sun and takes nearly 1 year to complete a revolution. \uf076The Earth\u2019s axis of rotation is not upright with respect to the orbit, but is tilted. \uf076Seasons occur because of the tilt of the Earth\u2019s axis of rotation and its spherical shape. \uf076A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon is in the path of the Sun as seen from the Earth, and sunlight is blocked from reaching the Earth. \uf076A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes in between the Sun and the Moon, blocking sunlight from reaching the Moon.
