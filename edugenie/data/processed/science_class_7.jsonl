This again, is not just a textbook with \nfacts\u2009\u2014\u2009it is an invitation to question, to perform experiments, \nand to explore, as we try to understand the beautiful world we \nlive in. The world of science covers everything\u2009\u2014\u2009small and large, \nnear and far. We may be looking at tiny cells inside a leaf, or \nthe movement of the sun and the stars. We may be testing out \nthe materials around us at home, or discussing how water \ufb02 ows \nunderground. As you go through the chapters in this book, you \nwill start new adventures that challenge your thinking, expand \nyour knowledge, and help you become an explorer, making small \ndiscoveries for yourself. Before we dive into our exciting journey, take a moment to \nobserve something special about this book. Look at the page \nnumbers\u2009\u2014\u2009they follow the playful \ufb02 ight of a butter\ufb02 y and the \nsoaring of a paper plane! Just as a butter\ufb02 y \ufb02 utters freely and a \npaper plane \ufb02 ies into the sky, learning takes \ufb02 ight when curiosity \nleads the way. Did you know that something as simple as a paper \nplane inspired real scienti\ufb01 c explorations of \ufb02 ight? From early \ninventors studying bird wings to modern engineers designing \naircraft, the dream of \ufb02 ying started with simple observations and \nexperiments. So, as you turn each page, let your imagination take \n\ufb02 ight\u2009\u2014\u2009exploring new ideas, discovering wonders, and reaching \nfor the skies!"}

Science, as we said \nin Grade 6, is a process, so it is about a way of thinking that \nwelcomes curiosity, asks questions, and is open to the unknown. In Grade 7, we will try to ask deeper questions: How do things \nwork? Why do events happen the way they do? And what can \nwe learn from the patterns that we see in nature? To do this, we have to step out of this book, step out of the \nclassroom perhaps, and experience the world through activities \nand experiments. These are experiences that we hope will not \njust be interesting or exciting but also serve as stepping stones \nto a deeper understanding of the environment we live in and of \nour place on this planet. We believe that this will also help you \nto see science as an ongoing process of discovery. And not just \nabout discovery alone, but also about responsibility. As young \nscience explorers, you will soon see how human activities are \nlinked to what happens in the natural world and are connected \nto the society we live in. You will, we hope, also see the role that \nscience can play in addressing environmental challenges and \nhelp in creating a more sustainable world. But let\u2019s get back into this book for now. You will read about \ntopics in di\ufb00 erent \ufb01 elds of science, from physics and chemistry \nto biology and earth sciences.

When \nlime water is added to this test tube, the colour of the solution \neventually changes from red to blue. This shows that the solution \nin the test tube is no longer acidic.

When the solution of an acid is mixed with the solution of a \nbase in su\ufb03  cient quantity, we \ufb01 nd that the resulting solution is \nneither acidic nor basic. Such reactions are called neutralisation\nreactions. In a neutralisation reaction, salt and water are formed \nwith the evolution (i.e., release) of heat. Acid + Base \u2192Salt + Water + Heat\nThere are many examples in everyday life where you can \nobserve the use of neutralisation processes.

It is observed in glass bottles A and B that the iron nails do not \nshow any brown deposits. What does this observation indicate? This indicates that brown deposits or discolouration on the iron \nnails do not develop when the iron nail is kept in dry air alone \n(bottle A) or water alone (bottle B). However, in glass bottle C, the \niron nail shows the presence of brown deposits. This indicates that \nthe presence of both water and air is essential for these deposits \nto develop. Thus, moist air is responsible for the development of \nbrown deposits on objects made of iron. This brown deposit is \ncalled rust. The process of formation of rust on objects made of \niron is called rusting. Many other metals also exhibit discolouration when kept open \nin the atmosphere. Have you noticed the formation of a green \ncoating on the surface of copper objects or a black coating on the \nsurface of silver objects? Gradual deterioration of metal surfaces \ncaused by air, water, or other substances is known as corrosion. Do you know that rusting of iron is a serious problem in our \ncountry?

For example, the \nchanging of milk into curd, ripening of fruits, cutting of fruits, \nand cooking of food. All these are desirable changes. Can you \nthink of some other desirable changes happening around you? Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical\n67\nOn the other hand, some changes may be undesirable, such \nas the rusting of iron or the decay of food during its storage. A change that is undesirable in some situations may be desirable \nin other situations. For example, decomposition of food can be \nvery useful in converting food waste into compost. Some changes occurring over the years due to human activity \ncan have a long-term environmental impact. For example, the \nincreased consumption of fuels in cars, trains, aeroplanes, etc., \nis increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

These are called sediments. How \nhave these formed? These are formed by physical changes that \nbreak up large rocks into smaller pieces. Temperature changes due \nto climatic conditions, growing roots of trees, and even freezing of \nwater within cracks in the rocks can cause them to break. Water or chemicals present in water, can also react with \nthe rocks and cause chemical changes in their composition."}

Here, \nan originally black-coloured rock called basalt, which contains \niron, has chemically changed to produce a red-coloured layer. The \nred colour is a result of the iron oxide produced when the rock \nsurface was exposed for a long time to water or air containing \nwater vapour. These physical and chemical changes in rocks are \ncollectively called weathering, which eventually leads to the \nformation of soil.

This sand is formed when rock pebbles, soil, and sediments are \nbroken down and moved from one location to another by natural \nforces like wind and \ufb02 owing water. This process is called erosion. Erosion during a landslide is an example of a physical change. River rocks and pebbles often appear smoother due to the \nconstant erosion caused by the \ufb02 owing water. When the speed \nof the water or wind decreases, such as in an ocean or a lake, the \nmaterial transported during erosion settles down at the bottom. These sediments harden over time and become new rocks. Most \nof these changes take place over thousands of years and cannot \nbe reversed. In a Nutshell\n\uf076A physical change is one in which a substance or object \nundergoes a change in its physical properties and no new \nsubstance is formed. \uf076A chemical change is one in which one or more new \nsubstances are formed.

Since adolescence is a stage of life marked by new experiences \nand emotions, we must be thoughtful and responsible while \ninteracting with others\u2009\u2014\u2009whether in person or through social \nmedia. This is the time adolescents may feel attracted to their \npeers, and mimic their behaviour. Today, they often interact \nwith each other online. Fig. 6.3: Collaborative learning in action\nModern technologies have made online platforms \navailable for all to obtain information, make \nconnections, interact, and share information with \neach other. We should use these platforms responsibly \nfor the collective well-being of all. Sometimes, we, \nknowingly or unknowingly, use social media platforms \ncarelessly. Seeking guidance from elders and teachers \ncan help use these platforms positively. Science and Society\nCyberbullying involves the use of digital devices such as phones, \ncomputers, or online platforms to harass others by sending misleading \nmessages, spreading false rumours, or sharing personal information \nwithout consent (Fig. 6.4). However, if someone tries to bully you, it is \nimportant not to feel scared or helpless. Rather, handle it wisely and \nseek help from parents and teachers."}

Since adolescence is marked by curiosity and \nexcitement, adolescents might get influenced by such people and try \nthese\u00a0substances. These substances are not just harmful to physical and mental \nhealth but are also addictive.

We now understand the different \nchanges in adolescence and also know \nsome ways to handle it with a sense of \nresponsibility. Many changes in adolescence, including menstruation and \nother signs of puberty, are mainly due to hormones\u2009\u2014\u2009certain \nchemicals produced in our bodies. Hormones play a crucial \nrole in regulating various aspects of growth and development, \ncontributing to the proper functioning of the body. They are \nproduced in different parts of the body and are released at an \nappropriate time in response to signals from the brain. Some \nhormones influence mood and behaviour."}

In a Nutshell\n\t\n\u0099 Adolescence is the period of change from childhood to \nadulthood. It generally begins around the age of 10 years \nand usually lasts until 19 years. \u0099 Adolescence is marked by significant and characteristic \nphysical, biological, and emotional changes. \u0099 Features that help to distinguish the male from the female \nbut are not directly involved in reproduction are called \nsecondary sexual characteristics. \u0099 Puberty is the stage in which the body of a child undergoes \nobservable and internal changes to develop into an adult \ncapable of reproduction. \u0099 Adolescence in girls is also marked by start of the menstrual \ncycle, during which there is a discharge of blood generally \nafter every 28\u201330 days, a process called menstruation. Menstruation begins at puberty and generally ends by the \nage of 45\u201355 years. \u0099 Adolescents face several emotional and behavioural changes. \u0099 Eating a balanced and healthy diet, maintaining good \npersonal hygiene, and participating in physical activities \nhelp adolescents to stay healthy. \u0099 Addictive substances, such as tobacco, alcohol, and drugs, \nhave adverse effects on the body and mind. It is wise to say \n\u2018NO\u2019 to these substances and stay away from them. \u0099 Changes that take place in the body during adolescence are \nprimarily controlled by certain chemicals produced in the \nbody. These chemicals are called hormones. \u0099 Proper guidance and awareness help adolescents manage \nphysical, emotional, and behavioural changes effectively. Let Us Enhance Our Learning\n1.

The melted ice is \nreplenished by fresh snow during winters. Water in the oceans, \nrivers, and lakes gets \nheated due to the Sun, and \nas a result, it evaporates \nas water vapour. Water \nalso \nevaporates \nfrom \ntrees and plants through \ntranspiration. When water vapour \nrises up, it cools down \nand condenses to form \nclouds. Clouds \nbring \nrain, snow, and hail. This process is called \nprecipitation. The continuous movement of water \u2014 upward as water vapour \nand downward through precipitation, passing through soil, rocks, \nand plants, and \ufb01 nally returning to water bodies, is called water \ncycle (Fig. 7.9).

You may have observed that water seeps fastest through \ngravel, slower through sand, and slowest through clay. Why \nis it so? The spaces between gravel particles are wider when \ncompared to those in sand and clay. Hence, water can seep \nthrough the gravel more easily. In this way, water seeps \nbeneath the surface of the Earth. This process of surface water \nseeping through soil and rocks is called in\ufb01 ltration. Water \ncan in\ufb01 ltrate more readily if the spaces between soil and \nrock particles are wider, open, and interconnected (Fig. 7.11). The water that seeps through gets stored in the pore spaces \nof sediments and the openings in rocks beneath the surface \nas groundwater. The underground layers of sediments and \nrocks that store water in pore spaces are called aquifers \n(Fig. 7.12).

They \nstarted noticing that many events in nature repeat themselves \nafter de\ufb01 nite intervals of time. For example, the rising and setting \nof the Sun, the phases of the Moon and the changing seasons. They started using the cycles of these events for timekeeping. First, they devised calendars.

How \nwas \ntime \nmeasured when there \nwere no clocks and \nwatches? So, they made many devices which \nhelped them to measure smaller intervals \nof time within a day. Some of these were \nsundials, water clocks, hourglasses, and \ncandle clocks. In a sundial, time is determined with \nthe changing position of the shadow of an \nobject cast by the light of the Sun during \nthe day (Fig. 8.1).

These clocks were not very \naccurate because as water levels dropped, the \ufb02 ow rate decreased. This led to the development of the sinking bowl water clock \n(Fig. 8.2b), or Ghatika-yantra, \ufb01 rst mentioned by Aryabhata, and then \nin several astronomical texts later. Time was measured constantly \nwith Ghatika-yantra at Buddhist monasteries, royal palaces, town \nsquares, and each time the bowl sank, it was announced by drums, \nconch shells, or striking a gong.

The \nunit time may be one second or one minute or one hour. We call \nthe distance covered by an object in a unit time as the speed of \nthe object. How can we determine the speed of an object? It can be \ncalculated, if we know the total distance covered by an object \nand the time taken to cover it. The speed of an object is the total \ndistance covered divided by the total time taken to cover it. Thus,\nSpeed = Total distance covered\n \nTotal time taken\nWhat would be the unit of speed? We know the SI units of \nlength and time. Since the speed is distance/time, the SI unit of \nspeed is metre/second and is expressed as m/s. Speed can also be expressed in other units.

This \nsemi-solid waste is called stool. The stool is then stored in the \nlower part of the large intestine, called the rectum, until the \nbody is ready to get rid of it. Eating \ufb01 bre-rich foods like fruits, \nvegetables, and whole grains helps the large intestine function \nproperly by making the stool easier to pass.

Isn\u2019t it fascinating how the digestive system works, absorbing \nnutrients from food and eliminating waste? FASCINATING FACTS\nThe large intestine contains various small living organisms, \nsuch as bacteria, that help in digestion. They help in keeping our \ndigestive system healthy. They break down undigested food, \nespecially \ufb01 bre, and produce essential nutrients. Fibre-rich \nfood, and especially \u2018fermented foods\u2019 (like curd, buttermilk, \nshrikhand, kanji, pickles, gundruk, and poita bhat) are good for \na healthy digestive system and overall well-being.

In a Nutshell\n\uf076The Earth rotates on its own axis in about 24 hours. \uf076The Earth\u2019s rotation from West to East causes day and night \nas well as the apparent motion of the Sun, the Moon, and \nthe stars. \uf076The Earth revolves around the Sun and takes nearly 1 year \nto complete a revolution. \uf076The Earth\u2019s axis of rotation is not upright with respect to the \norbit, but is tilted. \uf076Seasons occur because of the tilt of the Earth\u2019s axis of rotation \nand its spherical shape. \uf076A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon is in the path of the \nSun as seen from the Earth, and sunlight is blocked from \nreaching the Earth. \uf076A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes in between \nthe Sun and the Moon, blocking sunlight from reaching \nthe Moon. Let Us Enhance Our Learning\n1. In Fig. 12.17, how many hours of sunlight do the North Pole \nand the South Pole receive during one rotation of the Earth? 2.
