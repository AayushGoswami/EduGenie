The result of a measurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a number (or numerical measure) accompanied by a unit. Although the number of physical quantities appears to be very large, we need only a limited number of units for expressing all the physical quantities, since they are inter- related with one another. The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called fundamental or base units. The units of all other physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the derived quantities are called derived units. A complete set of these units, both the base units and derived units, is known as the system of units. 1.2 THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS In earlier time scientists of different countries were using different systems of units for measurement. Three such systems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS system were in use extensively till recently. The base units for length, mass and time in these systems were as follows : \u2022 In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second respectively. \u2022 In FPS system they were foot, pound and second respectively. \u2022 In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second respectively. The system of units which is at present internationally accepted for measurement is the Syst\u00e8me Internationale d\u2019 Unites (French for International System of Units), abbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols, units and abbreviations, developed by the Bureau International des Poids et measures (The International Bureau of Weights and Measures, BIPM) in 1971 were recently revised by the General Conference on Weights and Measures in November 2018."}

Thus, the result of measurement should be reported in a way that indicates the precision of measurement. Normally, the reported result of measurement is a number that includes all digits in the number that are known reliably plus the first digit that is uncertain. The reliable digits plus the first uncertain digit are known as significant digits or significant figures. If we say the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are reliable and certain, while the digit 2 is uncertain. Thus, the measured value has three significant figures. The length of an object reported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are certain while the digit 5 is uncertain. Clearly, reporting the result of measurement that includes more digits than the significant digits is superfluous and also misleading since it would give a wrong idea about the precision of measurement. The rules for determining the number of significant figures can be understood from the following examples. Significant figures indicate, as already mentioned, the precision of measurement which depends on the least count of the measuring instrument. A choice of change of different units does not change the number of significant digits or figures in a measurement. This important remark makes most of the following observations clear: (1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four significant figures. But in different units, the same value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08 mm or 23080 \u00b5m."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 5, "content": "All these numbers have the same number of significant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four. Reprint 2025-26 PHYSICS 4 This shows that the location of decimal point is of no consequence in determining the number of significant figures. The example gives the following rules : \u2022 All the non-zero digits are significant. \u2022 All the zeros between two non-zero digits are significant, no matter where the decimal point is, if at all. \u2022 If the number is less than 1, the zero(s) on the right of decimal point but to the left of the first non-zero digit are not significant. [In 0.00 2308, the underlined zeroes are not significant]. \u2022 The terminal or trailing zero(s) in a number without a decimal point are not significant. [Thus 123 m = 12300 cm = 123000 mm has three significant figures, the trailing zero(s) being not significant.] However, you can also see the next observation. \u2022 The trailing zero(s) in a number with a decimal point are significant. [The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four significant figures each.] (2) There can be some confusion regarding the trailing zero(s). Suppose a length is reported to be 4.700 m. It is evident that the zeroes here are meant to convey the precision of measurement and are, therefore, significant. [If these were not, it would be superfluous to write them explicitly, the reported measurement would have been simply 4.7 m]."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 6, "content": "Now suppose we change units, then 4.700 m = 470.0 cm = 4700 mm = 0.004700 km Since the last number has trailing zero(s) in a number with no decimal, we would conclude erroneously from observation (1) above that the number has two significant figures, while in fact, it has four significant figures and a mere change of units cannot change the number of significant figures. (3) To remove such ambiguities in determining the number of significant figures, the best way is to report every measurement in scientific notation (in the power of 10). In this notation, every number is expressed as a \u00d7 10b, where a is a number between 1 and 10, and b is any positive or negative exponent (or power) of 10. In order to get an approximate idea of the number, we may round off the number a to 1 (for a \u22645) and to 10 (for 5<a \u226410). Then the number can be expressed approximately as 10b in which the exponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of magnitude of the physical quantity. When only an estimate is required, the quantity is of the order of 10b. For example, the diameter of the earth (1.28\u00d7107m) is of the order of 107m with the order of magnitude 7. The diameter of hydrogen atom (1.06 \u00d710\u201310m) is of the order of 10\u201310m, with the order of magnitude \u201310. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders of magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom. It is often customary to write the decimal after the first digit. Now the confusion mentioned in (a) above disappears : 4.700 m = 4.700 \u00d7 102 cm = 4.700 \u00d7 103 mm = 4.700 \u00d7 10\u20133 km The power of 10 is irrelevant to the determination of significant figures."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 7, "content": "However, all zeroes appearing in the base number in the scientific notation are significant. Each number in this case has four significant figures. Thus, in the scientific notation, no confusion arises about the trailing zero(s) in the base number a. They are always significant. (4) The scientific notation is ideal for reporting measurement. But if this is not adopted, we use the rules adopted in the preceding example : \u2022 For a number greater than 1, without any decimal, the trailing zero(s) are not significant. \u2022 For a number with a decimal, the trailing zero(s) are significant. (5) The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a decimal for a number less than 1 (like 0.1250) is never significant. However, the zeroes at the end of such number are significant in a measurement. (6) The multiplying or dividing factors which are neither rounded numbers nor numbers representing measured values are exact and have infinite number of significant digits. For example in 2 d r = or s = 2\u03c0r, the factor 2 is an exact number and it can be written as 2.0, 2.00 Reprint 2025-26 UNITS AND MEASUREMENT 5 or 2.0000 as required. Similarly, in t T n = , n is an exact number. 1.3.1 Rules for Arithmetic Operations with Significant Figures The result of a calculation involving approximate measured values of quantities (i.e. values with limited number of significant figures) must reflect the uncertainties in the original measured values. It cannot be more accurate than the original measured values themselves on which the result is based. In general, the final result should not have more significant figures than the original data from which it was obtained."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 8, "content": "Thus, if mass of an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and its volume is measured to be 2.51 cm3, then its density, by mere arithmetic division, is 1.68804780876 g/cm3 upto 11 decimal places. It would be clearly absurd and irrelevant to record the calculated value of density to such a precision when the measurements on which the value is based, have much less precision. The following rules for arithmetic operations with significant figures ensure that the final result of a calculation is shown with the precision that is consistent with the precision of the input measured values : (1) In multiplication or division, the final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the original number with the least significant figures. Thus, in the example above, density should be reported to three significant figures. Density 4.237g 2.51 cm 1.69 g cm 3 -3 = = Similarly, if the speed of light is given as 3.00 \u00d7 108 m s-1 (three significant figure) and one year (1y = 365.25 d) has 3.1557 \u00d7 107 s (five significant figures), the light year is 9.47 \u00d7 1015 m (three significant figures). (2) In addition or subtraction, the final result should retain as many decimal places as are there in the number with the least decimal places. For example, the sum of the numbers 436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g by mere arithmetic addition, is 663.821 g. But the least precise measurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one decimal place."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 9, "content": "The final result should, therefore, be rounded off to 663.8 g. Similarly, the difference in length can be expressed as : 0.307 m \u2013 0.304 m = 0.003 m = 3 \u00d710\u20133 m. Note that we should not use the rule (1) applicable for multiplication and division and write 664 g as the result in the example of addition and 3.00 \u00d7 10\u20133 m in the example of subtraction. They do not convey the precision of measurement properly. For addition and subtraction, the rule is in terms of decimal places. 1.3.2 Rounding off the Uncertain Digits The result of computation with approximate numbers, which contain more than one uncertain digit, should be rounded off. The rules for rounding off numbers to the appropriate significant figures are obvious in most cases. A number 2.746 rounded off to three significant figures is 2.75, while the number 1.743 would be 1.74. The rule by convention is that the preceding digit is raised by 1 if the insignificant digit to be dropped (the underlined digit in this case) is more than 5, and is left unchanged if the latter is less than 5. But what if the number is 2.745 in which the insignificant digit is 5. Here, the convention is that if the preceding digit is even, the insignificant digit is simply dropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit is raised by 1. Then, the number 2.745 rounded off to three significant figures becomes 1.74. On the other hand, the number 2.735 rounded off to three significant figures becomes 1.74 since the preceding digit is odd. In any involved or complex multi-step calculation, you should retain, in intermediate steps, one digit more than the significant digits and round off to proper significant figures at the end of the calculation."}

Finally, remember that exact numbers that appear in formulae like 2 \u03c0 in T L g = 2\u03c0 , have a large (infinite) number Reprint 2025-26 PHYSICS 6 \u22b3 \u22b3 of significant figures.

What are the total surface area and the volume of the cube to appropriate significant figures? Answer The number of significant figures in the measured length is 4. The calculated area and the volume should therefore be rounded off to 4 significant figures. Surface area of the cube = 6(7.203)2 m2 = 311.299254 m2 = 311.3 m2 Volume of the cube = (7.203)3 m3 = 373.714754 m3 = 373.7 m3 \u22b3 Example 1.2 5.74 g of a substance occupies 1.2 cm3.

{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 11, "content": "(1) If the length and breadth of a thin rectangular sheet are measured, using a metre scale as 16.2 cm and, 10.1 cm respectively, there are three significant figures in each measurement. It means that the length l may be written as l = 16.2 \u00b1 0.1 cm = 16.2 cm \u00b1 0.6 %. Similarly, the breadth b may be written as b = 10.1 \u00b1 0.1 cm = 10.1 cm \u00b1 1 % Then, the error of the product of two (or more) experimental values, using the combination of errors rule, will be l b = 163.62 cm2 + 1.6% = 163.62 + 2.6 cm2 This leads us to quote the final result as l b = 164 + 3 cm2 Here 3 cm2 is the uncertainty or error in the estimation of area of rectangular sheet. (2) If a set of experimental data is specified to n significant figures, a result obtained by combining the data will also be valid to n significant figures. However, if data are subtracted, the number of significant figures can be reduced. For example, 12.9 g \u2013 7.06 g, both specified to three significant figures, cannot properly be evaluated as 5.84 g but only as 5.8 g, as uncertainties in subtraction or addition combine in a different fashion (smallest number of decimal places rather than the number of significant figures in any of the number added or subtracted). (3) The relative error of a value of number specified to significant figures depends not only on n but also on the number itself."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 12, "content": "For example, the accuracy in measurement of mass 1.02 g is \u00b1 0.01 g whereas another measurement 9.89 g is also accurate to \u00b1 0.01 g. The relative error in 1.02 g is = (\u00b1 0.01/1.02) \u00d7 100 % = \u00b1 1% Similarly, the relative error in 9.89 g is = (\u00b1 0.01/9.89) \u00d7 100 % = \u00b1 0.1 % Finally, remember that intermediate results in a multi-step computation should be calculated to one more significant figure in every measurement than the number of digits in the least precise measurement. These should be justified by the data and then the arithmetic operations may be carried out; Reprint 2025-26 UNITS AND MEASUREMENT 7 otherwise rounding errors can build up. For example, the reciprocal of 9.58, calculated (after rounding off) to the same number of significant figures (three) is 0.104, but the reciprocal of 0.104 calculated to three significant figures is 9.62. However, if we had written 1/9.58 = 0.1044 and then taken the reciprocal to three significant figures, we would have retrieved the original value of 9.58. This example justifies the idea to retain one more extra digit (than the number of digits in the least precise measurement) in intermediate steps of the complex multi-step calculations in order to avoid additional errors in the process of rounding off the numbers. 1.4 DIMENSIONS OF PHYSICAL QUANTITIES The nature of a physical quantity is described by its dimensions. All the physical quantities represented by derived units can be expressed in terms of some combination of seven fundamental or base quantities. We shall call these base quantities as the seven dimensions of the physical world, which are denoted with square brackets [ ]."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 13, "content": "Thus, length has the dimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current [A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous intensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol]. The dimensions of a physical quantity are the powers (or exponents) to which the base quantities are raised to represent that quantity. Note that using the square brackets [ ] round a quantity means that we are dealing with \u2018the dimensions of\u2019 the quantity. In mechanics, all the physical quantities can be written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M] and [T]. For example, the volume occupied by an object is expressed as the product of length, breadth and height, or three lengths. Hence the dimensions of volume are [L] \u00d7 [L] \u00d7 [L] = [L]3 = [L3]. As the volume is independent of mass and time, it is said to possess zero dimension in mass [M\u00b0], zero dimension in time [T\u00b0] and three dimensions in length. Similarly, force, as the product of mass and acceleration, can be expressed as Force = mass \u00d7 acceleration = mass \u00d7 (length)/(time)2 The dimensions of force are [M] [L]/[T]2 = [M L T\u20132]. Thus, the force has one dimension in mass, one dimension in length, and \u20132 dimensions in time. The dimensions in all other base quantities are zero. Note that in this type of representation, the magnitudes are not considered. It is the quality of the type of the physical quantity that enters. Thus, a change in velocity, initial velocity, average velocity, final velocity, and speed are all equivalent in this context. Since all these quantities can be expressed as length/time, their dimensions are [L]/[T] or [L T\u20131]."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 14, "content": "1.5 DIMENSIONAL FORMULAE AND DIMENSIONAL EQUATIONS The expression which shows how and which of the base quantities represent the dimensions of a physical quantity is called the dimensional formula of the given physical quantity. For example, the dimensional formula of the volume is [M\u00b0 L3 T\u00b0], and that of speed or velocity is [M\u00b0 L T-1]. Similarly, [M\u00b0 L T\u20132] is the dimensional formula of acceleration and [M L\u20133 T\u00b0] that of mass density. An equation obtained by equating a physical quantity with its dimensional formula is called the dimensional equation of the physical quantity. Thus, the dimensional equations are the equations, which represent the dimensions of a physical quantity in terms of the base quantities. For example, the dimensional equations of volume [V], speed [v], force [F ] and mass density [\u03c1] may be expressed as [V] = [M0 L3 T0] [v] = [M0 L T\u20131] [F] = [M L T\u20132] [\u03c1] = [M L\u20133 T0] The dimensional equation can be obtained from the equation representing the relations between the physical quantities. The dimensional formulae of a large number and wide variety of physical quantities, derived from the equations representing the relationships among other physical quantities and expressed in terms of base quantities are given in Appendix 9 for your guidance and ready reference. 1.6 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS AND ITS APPLICATIONS The recognition of concepts of dimensions, which guide the description of physical behaviour is of basic importance as only those physical Reprint 2025-26 PHYSICS 8 \u22b3 quantities can be added or subtracted which have the same dimensions. A thorough understanding of dimensional analysis helps us in deducing certain relations among different physical quantities and checking the derivation, accuracy and dimensional consistency or homogeneity of various mathematical expressions."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 15, "content": "When magnitudes of two or more physical quantities are multiplied, their units should be treated in the same manner as ordinary algebraic symbols. We can cancel identical units in the numerator and denominator. The same is true for dimensions of a physical quantity. Similarly, physical quantities represented by symbols on both sides of a mathematical equation must have the same dimensions. 1.6.1 Checking the Dimensional Consistency of Equations The magnitudes of physical quantities may be added together or subtracted from one another only if they have the same dimensions. In other words, we can add or subtract similar physical quantities. Thus, velocity cannot be added to force, or an electric current cannot be subtracted from the thermodynamic temperature. This simple principle called the principle of homogeneity of dimensions in an equation is extremely useful in checking the correctness of an equation. If the dimensions of all the terms are not same, the equation is wrong. Hence, if we derive an expression for the length (or distance) of an object, regardless of the symbols appearing in the original mathematical relation, when all the individual dimensions are simplified, the remaining dimension must be that of length. Similarly, if we derive an equation of speed, the dimensions on both the sides of equation, when simplified, must be of length/ time, or [L T\u20131]. Dimensions are customarily used as a preliminary test of the consistency of an equation, when there is some doubt about the correctness of the equation. However, the dimensional consistency does not guarantee correct equations. It is uncertain to the extent of dimensionless quantities or functions. The arguments of special functions, such as the trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions must be dimensionless."}

The dimensions of each term may be written as [x] = [L] [x0 ] = [L] [v0 t] = [L T\u20131] [T] = [L] [(1/2) a t2] = [L T\u20132] [T2] = [L] As each term on the right hand side of this equation has the same dimension, namely that of length, which is same as the dimension of left hand side of the equation, hence this equation is a dimensionally correct equation. It may be noted that a test of consistency of dimensions tells us no more and no less than a test of consistency of units, but has the advantage that we need not commit ourselves to a particular choice of units, and we need not worry about conversions among multiples and sub-multiples of the units. It may be borne in mind that if an equation fails this consistency test, it is proved wrong, but if it passes, it is not proved right. Thus, a dimensionally correct equation need not be actually an exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong (incorrect) or inconsistent equation must be wrong."}

For this we should know the dependence of the physical quantity on other quantities (upto three physical quantities or linearly independent variables) and consider it as a product type of the dependence. Let us take an example. Example 1.5 Consider a simple pendulum, having a bob attached to a string, that oscillates under the action of the force of gravity. Suppose that the period of oscillation of the simple pendulum depends on its length (l), mass of the bob (m) and acceleration due to gravity (g).

Reprint 2025-26 PHYSICS 10 SUMMARY 1. Physics is a quantitative science, based on measurement of physical quantities. Certain physical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities (such as length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity). 2. Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly standardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole and candela). The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called fundamental or base units. 3. Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a combination of the base units and are called derived units. A complete set of units, both fundamental and derived, is called a system of units. 4. The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present internationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world. 5. The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and the derived quantities obtained from them."}

The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m for metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.). 7. Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific notation, with powers of 10. Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify measurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision of the numbers. 8. Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical quantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for expressing properly the physical quantities and measurements. 9. In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the relationship(s) are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired units are obtained. 10. In measured and computed quantities proper significant figures only should be retained. Rules for determining the number of significant figures, carrying out arithmetic operations with them, and \u2018rounding off \u2018 the uncertain digits must be followed. 11. The dimensions of base quantities and combination of these dimensions describe the nature of physical quantities. Dimensional analysis can be used to check the dimensional consistency of equations, deducing relations among the physical quantities, etc. A dimensionally consistent equation need not be actually an exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong or inconsistent equation must be wrong.

Motion is change in position of an object with time. How does the position change with time ? In this chapter, we shall learn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the concepts of velocity and acceleration. We shall confine ourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight line, also known as rectilinear motion. For the case of rectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple equations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative nature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity. In our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as point objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size of the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a reasonable duration of time. In a good number of situations in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can be considered as point-like objects without much error.

Should it be described as the rate of change in velocity with distance or with time ? This was a problem even in Galileo\u2019s time. It was first thought that this change could be described by the rate of change of velocity with distance.

The origin and the positive direction of an axis are a matter of choice. You should first specify this choice before you assign signs to quantities like displacement, velocity and acceleration. 2. If a particle is speeding up, acceleration is in the direction of velocity; if its speed is decreasing, acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity. This statement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis. 3. The sign of acceleration does not tell us whether the particle\u2019s speed is increasing or decreasing. The sign of acceleration (as mentioned in point 3) depends on the choice of the positive direction of the axis. For example, if the vertically upward direction is chosen to be the positive direction of the axis, the acceleration due to gravity is negative. If a particle is falling under gravity, this acceleration, though negative, results in increase in speed. For a particle thrown upward, the same negative acceleration (of gravity) results in decrease in speed. 4. The zero velocity of a particle at any instant does not necessarily imply zero acceleration at that instant."}

So, a vector is specified by giving its magnitude by a number and its direction. Some physical quantities that are represented by vectors are displacement, velocity, acceleration and force. To represent a vector, we use a bold face type in this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be represented by a symbol v. Since bold face is difficult to produce, when written by hand, a vector is often represented by an arrow placed over a letter, say rv . Thus, both v and rv represent the velocity vector. The magnitude of a vector is often called its absolute value, indicated by |v| = v.

Multiplying a given vector A by negative numbers, say \u20131 and \u20131.5, gives vectors as shown in Fig 3.3(b). The factor \u03bb by which a vector A is multiplied could be a scalar having its own physical dimension. Then, the dimension of \u03bb A is the product of the dimensions of \u03bb and A.

We shall now describe this law of addition using the graphical method. Let us consider two vectors A and B that lie in a plane as shown in Fig. 3.4(a). The lengths of the line segments representing these vectors are proportional to the magnitude of the vectors. To find the sum A + B, we place vector B so that its tail is at the head of the vector A, as in Fig. 3.4(b). Then, we join the tail of A to the head of B. This line OQ represents a vector R, that is, the sum of the vectors A and B. Since, in this procedure of vector addition, vectors are Fig. 3.2 (a) Two equal vectors A and B.

If we find the resultant of B + A as in Fig. 3.4(c), the same vector R is obtained. Thus, vector addition is commutative: A + B = B + A (3.1) The addition of vectors also obeys the associative law as illustrated in Fig. 3.4(d). The result of adding vectors A and B first and then adding vector C is the same as the result of adding B and C first and then adding vector A : (A + B) + C = A + (B + C) (3.2) What is the result of adding two equal and opposite vectors ? Consider two vectors A and \u2013A shown in Fig. 3.3(b). Their sum is A + (\u2013A). Since the magnitudes of the two vectors are the same, but the directions are opposite, the resultant vector has zero magnitude and is represented by 0 called a null vector or a zero vector : A \u2013 A = 0 |0|= 0 (3.3) Since the magnitude of a null vector is zero, its direction cannot be specified.

This is why this acceleration is called centripetal acceleration (a term proposed by Newton). A thorough analysis of centripetal acceleration was first published in 1673 by the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) but it was probably known to Newton also some years earlier. \u201cCentripetal\u201d comes from a Greek term which means \u2018centre-seeking\u2019. Since v and R are constant, the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is also constant. However, the direction changes \u2014 pointing always towards the centre. Therefore, a centripetal acceleration is not a constant vector. We have another way of describing the velocity and the acceleration of an object in uniform circular motion.

The path length traversed by an object between two points is, in general, not the same as the magnitude of displacement. The displacement depends only on the end points; the path length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. The two quantities are equal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all other cases, the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement. 2. In view of point 1 above, the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the path length is equal to the magnitude of displacement. 3. The vector equations (3.33a) and (3.34a) do not involve any choice of axes. Of course, you can always resolve them along any two independent axes. 4. The kinematic equations for uniform acceleration do not apply to the case of uniform circular motion since in this case the magnitude of acceleration is constant but its direction is changing. 5.

Let us first guess the answer based on our common experience. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it. To throw a stone upwards, one has to give it an upward push. A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a strong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a flowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external agency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest. Likewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop motion. You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by applying a force against the direction of its motion. In these examples, the external agency of force (hands, wind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not always necessary. A stone released from the top of a building accelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the earth. A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance. This shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and magnetic forces ) can exert force on a body even from a distance. In short, a force is required to put a stationary body in motion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is needed to provide this force. The external agency may or may not be in contact with the body. So far so good. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g. a skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal ice slab) ? Is an external force required to keep a body in uniform motion?"}

However, it took ages to answer it. Indeed, the correct answer to this question given by Galileo in the seventeenth century was the foundation of Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the birth of modern science. The Greek thinker, Aristotle (384 B.C\u2013 322 B.C. ), held the view that if a body is moving, something external is required to keep it moving. According to this view, for example, an arrow shot from a bow keeps flying since the air behind the arrow keeps pushing it. The view was part of an elaborate framework of ideas developed by Aristotle on the motion of bodies in the universe. Most of the Aristotelian ideas on motion are now known to be wrong and need not concern us. For our purpose here, the Aristotelian law of motion may be phrased thus: An external force is required to keep a body in motion. Aristotelian law of motion is flawed, as we shall see. However, it is a natural view that anyone would hold from common experience. Even a small child playing with a simple (non-electric) toy-car on a floor knows intuitively that it needs to constantly drag the string attached to the toy- car with some force to keep it going. If it releases the string, it comes to rest. This experience is common to most terrestrial motion."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 91, "content": "External forces seem to be needed to keep bodies in motion. Left to themselves, all bodies eventually come to rest. What is the flaw in Aristotle\u2019s argument? The answer is: a moving toy car comes to rest because the external force of friction on the car by the floor opposes its motion. To counter this force, the child has to apply an external force on the car in the direction of motion. When the car is in uniform motion, there is no net external force acting on it: the force by the child cancels the force ( friction) by the floor. The corollary is: if there were no friction, the child would not be required to apply any force to keep the toy car in uniform motion. The opposing forces such as friction (solids) and viscous forces (for fluids) are always present in the natural world. This explains why forces by external agencies are necessary to overcome the frictional forces to keep bodies in uniform motion. Now we understand where Aristotle went wrong. He coded this practical experience in the form of a basic argument. To get at the true law of nature for forces and motion, one has to imagine a world in which uniform motion is possible with no frictional forces opposing. This is what Galileo did. 4.3 THE LAW OF INERTIA Galileo studied motion of objects on an inclined plane. Objects (i) moving down an inclined plane accelerate, while those (ii) moving up retard. (iii) Motion on a horizontal plane is an interme- diate situation. Galileo concluded that an object moving on a frictionless horizontal plane must neither have acceleration nor retardation, i.e. it should move with constant velocity (Fig. 4.1(a)). (i) (ii) (iii) Fig."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 92, "content": "4.1(a) Another experiment by Galileo leading to the same conclusion involves a double inclined plane. A ball released from rest on one of the planes rolls down and climbs up the other. If the planes are smooth, the final height of the ball is nearly the same as the initial height (a little less but never greater). In the ideal situation, when friction is absent, the final height of the ball is the same as its initial height. If the slope of the second plane is decreased and the experiment repeated, the ball will still reach the same height, but in doing so, it will travel a longer distance. In the limiting case, when the slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a horizontal) the ball travels an infinite distance. In other words, its motion never ceases. This is, of course, an idealised situation (Fig. 4.1(b)). Fig. 4.1(b) The law of inertia was inferred by Galileo from observations of motion of a ball on a double inclined plane. Reprint 2025-26 LAWS OF MOTION 51 In practice, the ball does come to a stop after moving a finite distance on the horizontal plane, because of the opposing force of friction which can never be totally eliminated. However, if there were no friction, the ball would continue to move with a constant velocity on the horizontal plane. Galileo thus, arrived at a new insight on motion that had eluded Aristotle and those who followed him. The state of rest and the state of uniform linear motion (motion with constant velocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is no net force acting on the body. It is incorrect to assume that a net force is needed to keep a body in uniform motion."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 93, "content": "To maintain a body in uniform motion, we need to apply an external force to ecounter the frictional force, so that the two forces sum up to zero net external force. To summarise, if the net external force is zero, a body at rest continues to remain at rest and a body in motion continues to move with a uniform velocity. This property of the body is called inertia. Inertia means \u2018resistance to change\u2019. A body does not change its state of rest or uniform motion, unless an external force compels it to change that state. 4.4 NEWTON\u2019S FIRST LAW OF MOTION Galileo\u2019s simple, but revolutionary ideas dethroned Aristotelian mechanics. A new mechanics had to be developed. This task was Ideas on Motion in Ancient Indian Science Ancient Indian thinkers had arrived at an elaborate system of ideas on motion. Force, the cause of motion, was thought to be of different kinds : force due to continuous pressure (nodan), as the force of wind on a sailing vessel; impact (abhighat), as when a potter\u2019s rod strikes the wheel; persistent tendency (sanskara) to move in a straight line(vega) or restoration of shape in an elastic body; transmitted force by a string, rod, etc. The notion of (vega) in the Vaisesika theory of motion perhaps comes closest to the concept of inertia. Vega, the tendency to move in a straight line, was thought to be opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere, a parallel to the ideas of friction and air resistance. It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational, rotational and vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent particles."}

There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of motion and units of length and time. It was known that the position of a particle in space can be indicated by distance measured along three axes. Bhaskara (1150 A.D.) had introduced the concept of \u2018instantaneous motion\u2019 (tatkaliki gati), which anticipated the modern notion of instantaneous velocity using Differential Calculus. The difference between a wave and a current (of water) was clearly understood; a current is a motion of particles of water under gravity and fluidity while a wave results from the transmission of vibrations of water particles. accomplished almost single-handedly by Isaac Newton, one of the greatest scientists of all times. Newton built on Galileo\u2019s ideas and laid the foundation of mechanics in terms of three laws of motion that go by his name. Galileo\u2019s law of inertia was his starting point which he formu- lated as the first law of motion: Every body continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise. The state of rest or uniform linear motion both imply zero acceleration. The first law of motion can, therefore, be simply expressed as: If the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero. Acceleration can be non zero only if there is a net external force on the body. Two kinds of situations are encountered in the application of this law in practice. In some examples, we know that the net external force on the object is zero."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 95, "content": "In that case we can conclude that the acceleration of the object is zero. For example, a spaceship out in interstellar space, far from all other objects and with all its rockets turned off, has no net external force acting on it. Its acceleration, according to the first law, must be zero. If it is in motion, it must continue to move with a uniform velocity. Reprint 2025-26 PHYSICS 52 \u22b3 More often, however, we do not know all the forces to begin with. In that case, if we know that an object is unaccelerated (i.e. it is either at rest or in uniform linear motion), we can infer from the first law that the net external force on the object must be zero. Gravity is everywhere. For terrestrial phenomena, in particular, every object experiences gravitational force due to the earth. Also objects in motion generally experience friction, viscous drag, etc. If then, on earth, an object is at rest or in uniform linear motion, it is not because there are no forces acting on it, but because the various external forces cancel out i.e. add up to zero net external force. Consider a book at rest on a horizontal surface Fig. (4.2(a)). It is subject to two external forces : the force due to gravity (i.e. its weight W) acting downward and the upward force on the book by the table, the normal force R . R is a self-adjusting force. This is an example of the kind of situation mentioned above. The forces are not quite known fully but the state of motion is known. We observe the book to be at rest."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 96, "content": "Therefore, we conclude from the first law that the magnitude of R equals that of W. A statement often encountered is : \u201cSince W = R, forces cancel and, therefore, the book is at rest\u201d. This is incorrect reasoning. The correct statement is : \u201cSince the book is observed to be at rest, the net external force on it must be zero, according to the first law. This implies that the normal force R must be equal and opposite to the weight W \u201d. Fig. 4.2 (a) a book at rest on the table, and (b) a car moving with uniform velocity. The net force is zero in each case. Consider the motion of a car starting from rest, picking up speed and then moving on a smooth straight road with uniform speed (Fig. (4.2(b)). When the car is stationary, there is no net force acting on it. During pick-up, it accelerates. This must happen due to a net external force. Note, it has to be an external force. The acceleration of the car cannot be accounted for by any internal force. This might sound surprising, but it is true. The only conceivable external force along the road is the force of friction. It is the frictional force that accelerates the car as a whole. (You will learn about friction in section 4.9). When the car moves with constant velocity, there is no net external force. The property of inertia contained in the First law is evident in many situations. Suppose we are standing in a stationary bus and the driver starts the bus suddenly. We get thrown backward with a jerk. Why ? Our feet are in touch with the floor."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 97, "content": "If there were no friction, we would remain where we were, while the floor of the bus would simply slip forward under our feet and the back of the bus would hit us. However, fortunately, there is some friction between the feet and the floor. If the start is not too sudden, i.e. if the acceleration is moderate, the frictional force would be enough to accelerate our feet along with the bus. But our body is not strictly a rigid body. It is deformable, i.e. it allows some relative displacement between different parts. What this means is that while our feet go with the bus, the rest of the body remains where it is due to inertia. Relative to the bus, therefore, we are thrown backward. As soon as that happens, however, the muscular forces on the rest of the body (by the feet) come into play to move the body along with the bus. A similar thing happens when the bus suddenly stops. Our feet stop due to the friction which does not allow relative motion between the feet and the floor of the bus. But the rest of the body continues to move forward due to inertia. We are thrown forward. The restoring muscular forces again come into play and bring the body to rest.

One reason is that the cricketer allows a longer time for his hands to stop the ball. As you may have noticed, he draws in the hands backward in the act of catching the ball (Fig. 4.3). The novice, on the other hand, keeps his hands fixed and tries to catch the ball almost instantly. He needs to provide a much greater force to stop the ball instantly, and this hurts. The conclusion is clear: force not only depends on the change in momentum, but also on how fast the change is brought about. The same change in momentum brought about in a shorter time needs a greater applied force. In short, the greater the rate of change of momentum, the greater is the force. Fig. 4.3 Force not only depends on the change in momentum but also on how fast the change is brought about. A seasoned cricketer draws in his hands during a catch, allowing greater time for the ball to stop and hence requires a smaller force. \u2022 Observations confirm that the product of mass and velocity (i.e. momentum) is basic to the effect of force on motion. Suppose a fixed force is applied for a certain interval of time on two bodies of different masses, initially at rest, the lighter body picks up a greater speed than the heavier body. However, at the end of the time interval, observations show that each body acquires the same momentum. Thus the same force for the same time causes the same change in momentum for different bodies."}

Similarly, a greater opposing force is needed to stop a heavy body than a light body in the same time, if they are moving with the same speed. \u2022 If two stones, one light and the other heavy, are dropped from the top of a building, a person on the ground will find it easier to catch the light stone than the heavy stone. The mass of a body is thus an important parameter that determines the effect of force on its motion. \u2022 Speed is another important parameter to consider."}

The same bullet fired with moderate speed will not cause much damage. Thus for a given mass, the greater the speed, the greater is the opposing force needed to stop the body in a certain time. Taken together, the product of mass and velocity, that is momentum, is evidently a relevant variable of motion. The greater the change in the momentum in a given time, the greater is the force that needs to be applied. \u2022 A seasoned cricketer catches a cricket ball coming in with great speed far more easily than a novice, who can hurt his hands in the Reprint 2025-26 PHYSICS 54 character of momentum has not been evident. In the examples so far, momentum and change in momentum both have the same direction. But this is not always the case. Suppose a stone is rotated with uniform speed in a horizontal plane by means of a string, the magnitude of momentum is fixed, but its direction changes (Fig. 4.4). A force is needed to cause this change in momentum vector. This force is provided by our hand through the string. Experience suggests that our hand needs to exert a greater force if the stone is rotated at greater speed or in a circle of smaller radius, or both. This corresponds to greater acceleration or equivalently a greater rate of change in momentum vector. This suggests that the greater the rate of change in momentum vector the greater is the force applied. Fig. 4.4 Force is necessary for changing the direction of momentum, even if its magnitude is constant. We can feel this while rotating a stone in a horizontal circle with uniform speed by means of a string."}

In the second law, F = 0 implies a = 0. The second law is obviously consistent with the first law. 2. The second law of motion is a vector law. It is equivalent to three equations, one for each component of the vectors : F p t ma x x x = = d d F p t ma y y y = = d d z z z a m t p F = = d d (4.6) This means that if a force is not parallel to the velocity of the body, but makes some angle with it, it changes only the component of velocity along the direction of force.

(4.5) is applicable to a single point particle. The force F in the law stands for the net external force on the particle and a stands for acceleration of the particle. It turns out, however, that the law in the same form applies to a rigid body or, even more generally, to a system of particles. In that case, F refers to the total external force on the system and a refers to the acceleration of the system as a whole.

The second law of motion is a local relation which means that force F at a point in space (location of the particle) at a certain instant of time is related to a at that point at that instant.

For example, when a ball hits a wall and bounces back, the force on the ball by the wall acts for a very short time when the two are in contact, yet the force is large enough to reverse the momentum of the ball. Often, in these situations, the force and the time duration are difficult to ascertain separately.

What is the origin of the external force on the body ? What agency provides the external force ? The simple answer in Newtonian mechanics is that the external force on a body always arises due to some other body. Consider a pair of bodies A and B. B gives rise to an external force on A. A natural question is: Does A in turn give rise to an external force on B ? In some examples, the answer seems clear. If you press a coiled spring, the spring is compressed by the force of your hand. The compressed spring in turn exerts a force on your hand and you can feel it. But what if the bodies are not in contact ? The earth pulls a stone downwards due to gravity. Does the stone exert a force on the earth ? The answer is not obvious since we hardly see the effect of the stone on the earth. The answer according to Newton is: Yes, the stone does exert an equal and opposite force on the earth. We do not notice it since the earth is very massive and the effect of a small force on its motion is negligible. Thus, according to Newtonian mechanics, force never occurs singly in nature."}

The terms action and reaction in the third law mean nothing else but \u2018force\u2019. Using different terms for the same physical concept can sometimes be confusing.

The terms action and reaction in the third law may give a wrong impression that action comes before reaction i.e action is the cause and reaction the effect.

It is an error to add up the two forces and claim that the net force is zero.

Take a familiar example. A bullet is fired from a gun. If the force on the bullet by the gun is F, the force on the gun by the bullet is \u2013 F, according to the third law. The two forces act for a common interval of time \u2206t. According to the second law, F \u2206t is the change in momentum of the bullet and \u2013 F \u2206t is the change in momentum of the gun. Since initially, both are at rest, the change in momentum equals the final momentum for each. Thus if pb is the momentum of the bullet after firing and pg is the recoil momentum of the gun, pg = \u2013 pb i.e. pb + pg = 0. That is, the total momentum of the (bullet + gun) system is conserved. Thus in an isolated system (i.e. a system with no external force), mutual forces between pairs of particles in the system can cause momentum change in individual particles, but since the mutual forces for each pair are equal and opposite, the momentum changes cancel in pairs and the total momentum remains unchanged. This fact is known as the law of conservation of momentum : Reprint 2025-26 PHYSICS 58 \u22b3 The total momentum of an isolated system of interacting particles is conserved. An important example of the application of the law of conservation of momentum is the collision of two bodies."}

The gravitational force is, of course, pervasive. Every object on the earth experiences the force of gravity due to the earth. Gravity also governs the motion of celestial bodies. The gravitational force can act at a distance without the need of any intervening medium. All the other forces common in mechanics are contact forces. * As the name suggests, a contact force on an object arises due to contact with some other object: solid or fluid. When bodies are in contact (e.g. a book resting on a table, a system of rigid bodies connected by rods, hinges and other types of supports), there are mutual contact forces (for each pair of bodies) satisfying the third law. The component of contact force normal to the surfaces in contact is called normal reaction. The component parallel to the surfaces in contact is called friction. Contact forces arise also when solids are in contact with fluids. For example, for a solid immersed in a fluid, there is an upward bouyant force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 113, "content": "The viscous force, air resistance, etc are also examples of contact forces (Fig. 4.9). Two other common forces are tension in a string and the force due to spring. When a spring is compressed or extended by an external force, a restoring force is generated. This force is usually proportional to the compression or elongation (for small displacements). The spring force F is written as F = \u2013 k x where x is the displacement and k is the force constant. The negative sign denotes that the force is opposite to the displacement from the unstretched state. For an inextensible string, the force constant is very high. The restoring force in a string is called tension. It is customary to use a constant tension T throughout the string. This assumption is true for a string of negligible mass. We learnt that there are four fundamental forces in nature. Of these, the weak and strong forces appear in domains that do not concern us here. Only the gravitational and electrical forces are relevant in the context of mechanics. The different contact forces of mechanics mentioned above fundamentally arise from electrical forces. This may seem surprising * We are not considering, for simplicity, charged and magnetic bodies. For these, besides gravity, there are electrical and magnetic non-contact forces.

The force of gravity (mg) is cancelled by the normal reaction force (N) of the table. Now suppose a force F is applied horizontally to the body. We know from experience that a small applied force may not be enough to move the body. But if the applied force F were the only external force on the body, it must move with acceleration F/m, however small. Clearly, the body remains at rest because some other force comes into play in the horizontal direction and opposes the applied force F, resulting in zero net force on the body. This force fs parallel to the surface of the body in contact with the table is known as frictional force, or simply friction (Fig. 4.10(a)). The subscript stands for static friction to distinguish it from kinetic friction fk that we consider later (Fig. 4.10(b)).

We know from experience that as the applied force exceeds a certain limit, the body begins to move. It is found experimentally that the limiting value of static friction ( )max sf is independent of the area of contact and varies with the normal force(N) approximately as : ( )max s s f N = \u00b5 (4.13) where \u00b5s is a constant of proportionality depending only on the nature of the surfaces in contact.

Frictional force that opposes relative motion between surfaces in contact is called kinetic or sliding friction and is denoted by fk . Kinetic friction, like static fric- tion, is found to be independent of the area of contact. Further, it is nearly independent of the velocity.

If the box is stationary relative to the train, it is in fact accelerating along with the train. What forces cause the acceleration of the box? Clearly, the only conceivable force in the horizontal direction is the force of friction. If there were no friction, the floor of the train would slip by and the box would remain at its initial position due to inertia (and hit the back side of the train).

Rolling friction again has a complex origin, though somewhat different from that of static and sliding friction. During rolling, the surfaces in contact get momentarily deformed a little, and this results in a finite area (not a point) of the body being in contact with the surface. The net effect is that the component of the contact force parallel to the surface opposes motion. We often regard friction as something undesirable. In many situations, like in a machine with different moving parts, friction does have a negative role. It opposes relative motion and thereby dissipates power in the form of heat, etc. Lubricants are a way of reducing kinetic friction in a machine. Another way is to use ball bearings between two moving parts of a machine [Fig. 4.13(a)]. Since the rolling friction between ball bearings and the surfaces in contact is very small, power dissipation is reduced. A thin cushion of air maintained between solid surfaces in relative motion is another effective way of reducing friction (Fig. 4.13(a)). In many practical situations, however, friction is critically needed. Kinetic friction that dissipates power is nevertheless important for quickly stopping relative motion. It is made use of by brakes in machines and automobiles. Similarly, static friction is important in daily life."}

We know, in practice, this will not happen and some resistance to motion (rolling friction) does occur, i.e. to keep the body rolling, some applied force is needed. For the same weight, rolling friction is much smaller (even by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude) than static or sliding friction. This Fig. 4.13 Some ways of reducing friction.

Answer On an unbanked road, frictional force alone can provide the centripetal force needed to keep the cyclist moving on a circular turn without slipping. If the speed is too large, or if the turn is too sharp (i.e. of too small a radius) or both, the frictional force is not sufficient to provide the necessary centripetal force, and the cyclist slips.

You should now be able to handle a large variety of problems in mechanics. A typical problem in mechanics usually does not merely involve a single body under the action of given forces. More often, we will need to consider an assembly of different bodies exerting forces on each other. Besides, each body in the assembly experiences the force of gravity. When trying to solve a problem of this type, it is useful to remember the fact that we can choose any part of the assembly and apply the laws of motion to that part provided we include all forces on the chosen part due to the remaining parts of the assembly."}

To handle a typical problem in mechanics systematically, one should use the following steps : (i) Draw a diagram showing schematically the various parts of the assembly of bodies, the links, supports, etc. (ii) Choose a convenient part of the assembly as one system. (iii) Draw a separate diagram which shows this system and all the forces on the system by the remaining part of the assembly. Include also the forces on the system by other agencies. Do not include the forces on the environment by the system. A diagram of this type is known as \u2018a free-body diagram\u2019.

{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 127, "content": "A number of exercises in this and subsequent chapters will help you cultivate this practice. SUMMARY 1. Aristotle\u2019s view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong. A force is necessary in practice to counter the opposing force of friction. 2. Galileo extrapolated simple observations on motion of bodies on inclined planes, and arrived at the law of inertia. Newton\u2019s first law of motion is the same law rephrased thus: \u201cEverybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise\u201d. In simple terms, the First Law is \u201cIf external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero\u201d. 3. Momentum (p ) of a body is the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v) : p = m v 4. Newton\u2019s second law of motion : The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts. Thus d d k k m t = = p F a where F is the net external force on the body and a its acceleration. We set the constant of proportionality k = 1 in SI units. Then d d m t = = p F a The SI unit of force is newton : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2. (a) The second law is consistent with the First Law (F = 0 implies a = 0) (b) It is a vector equation (c) It is applicable to a particle, and also to a body or a system of particles, provided F is the total external force on the system and a is the acceleration of the system as a whole."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 128, "content": "(d) F at a point at a certain instant determines a at the same point at that instant. That is the Second Law is a local law; a at an instant does not depend on the history of motion. 4. Impulse is the product of force and time which equals change in momentum. The notion of impulse is useful when a large force acts for a short time to produce a measurable change in momentum. Since the time of action of the force is very short, one can assume that there is no appreciable change in the position of the body during the action of the impulsive force. 6. Newton\u2019s third law of motion: To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction Reprint 2025-26 LAWS OF MOTION 67 In simple terms, the law can be stated thus : Forces in nature always occur between pairs of bodies. Force on a body A by body B is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A. Action and reaction forces are simultaneous forces. There is no cause-effect relation between action and reaction. Any of the two mutual forces can be called action and the other reaction. Action and reaction act on different bodies and so they cannot be cancelled out. The internal action and reaction forces between different parts of a body do, however, sum to zero. 7. Law of Conservation of Momentum The total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved. The law follows from the second and third law of motion. 8. Friction Frictional force opposes (impending or actual) relative motion between two surfaces in contact. It is the component of the contact force along the common tangent to the surface in contact."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 129, "content": "Static friction fs opposes impending relative motion; kinetic friction fk opposes actual relative motion. They are independent of the area of contact and satisfy the following approximate laws : ( )max f f R s s s \u2264 = \u00b5 k f R k = \u00b5 \u00b5s (co-efficient of static friction) and \u00b5k (co-efficient of kinetic friction) are constants characteristic of the pair of surfaces in contact. It is found experimentally that \u00b5k is less than \u00b5s . POINTS TO PONDER 1. Force is not always in the direction of motion. Depending on the situation, F may be along v, opposite to v, normal to v or may make some other angle with v. In every case, it is parallel to acceleration. 2. If v = 0 at an instant, i.e. if a body is momentarily at rest, it does not mean that force or acceleration are necessarily zero at that instant. For example, when a ball thrown upward reaches its maximum height, v = 0 but the force continues to be its weight mg and the acceleration is not zero but g. 3. Force on a body at a given time is determined by the situation at the location of the body at that time. Force is not \u2018carried\u2019 by the body from its earlier history of motion. The moment after a stone is released out of an accelerated train, there is no horizontal force (or acceleration) on the stone, if the effects of the surrounding air are neglected. The stone then has only the vertical force of gravity. 4. In the second law of motion F = m a, F stands for the net force due to all material agencies external to the body. a is the effect of the force."}

The centripetal force should not be regarded as yet another kind of force. It is simply a name given to the force that provides inward radial acceleration to a body in circular motion. We should always look for some material force like tension, gravitational force, electrical force, friction, etc as the centripetal force in any circular motion. 6. Static friction is a self-adjusting force up to its limit \u00b5s N (fs \u2264 \u00b5s N). Do not put fs= \u00b5s N without being sure that the maximum value of static friction is coming into play. 7. The familiar equation mg = R for a body on a table is true only if the body is in equilibrium. The two forces mg and R can be different (e.g. a body in an accelerated lift). The equality of mg and R has no connection with the third law. 8. The terms \u2018action\u2019 and \u2018reaction\u2019 in the third Law of Motion simply stand for simultaneous mutual forces between a pair of bodies. Unlike their meaning in ordinary language, action does not precede or cause reaction. Action and reaction act on different bodies. 9.

For clarity, every force and its equivalent terms encountered in mechanics should be reduced to the phrase \u2018force on A by B\u2019. 10.

For example, without the external force of friction, we cannot walk on the ground. 11."}

A farmer ploughing the field, a construction worker carrying bricks, a student studying for a competitive examination, an artist painting a beautiful landscape, all are said to be working. In physics, however, the word \u2018Work\u2019 covers a definite and precise meaning. Somebody who has the capacity to work for 14-16 hours a day is said to have a large stamina or energy. We admire a long distance runner for her stamina or energy. Energy is thus our capacity to do work."}

The word \u2018power\u2019 is used in everyday life with different shades of meaning. In karate or boxing we talk of \u2018powerful\u2019 punches. These are delivered at a great speed. This shade of meaning is close to the meaning of the word \u2018power\u2019 used in physics. We shall find that there is at best a loose correlation between the physical definitions and the physiological pictures these terms generate in our minds. The aim of this chapter is to develop an understanding of these three physical quantities. Before we proceed to this task, we need to develop a mathematical prerequisite, namely the scalar product of two vectors. 5.1.1 The Scalar Product We have learnt about vectors and their use in Chapter 3. Physical quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration, force etc. are vectors. We have also learnt how vectors are added or subtracted. We now need to know how vectors are multiplied. There are two ways of multiplying vectors which we shall come across : one way known as the scalar product gives a scalar from two vectors and the other known as the vector product produces a new vector from two vectors. We shall look at the vector product in Chapter 6. Here we take up the scalar product of two vectors."}

Since A, B and cos \u03b8 are scalars, the dot product of A and B is a scalar quantity. Each vector, A and B, has a direction but their scalar product does not have a direction. From Eq.

So, A.B is the product of the magnitude of A and the component of B along A. Alternatively, it is the product of the magnitude of B and the component of A along B.

This quantity is called \u2018work\u2019 and is denoted by W. Eq. (5.2b) is then Kf \u2212 Ki = W (5.3) where Ki and Kf are respectively the initial and final kinetic energies of the object. Work refers to the force and the displacement over which it acts. Work is done by a force on the body over a certain displacement. Equation (5.2) is also a special case of the work-energy (WE) theorem : The change in kinetic energy of a particle is equal to the work done on it by the net force. We shall generalise the above derivation to a varying force in a later section.

(b) From Newton\u2019s Third Law an equal and opposite force acts on the road due to the cycle. Its magnitude is 200 N. However, the road undergoes no displacement. Thus, work done by cycle on the road is zero. \u22b3 The lesson of Example 5.3 is that though the force on a body A exerted by the body B is always equal and opposite to that on B by A (Newton\u2019s Third Law); the work done on A by B is not necessarily equal and opposite to the work done on B by A. 5.4 KINETIC ENERGY As noted earlier, if an object of mass m has velocity v, its kinetic energy K is 2 K m mv 1 1 = = 2 2 v v . (5.5) Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity. The kinetic energy of an object is a measure of the work an The work done by the force is defined to be the product of component of the force in the direction of the displacement and the magnitude of this displacement. Thus W = (F cos \u03b8 )d = F.d (5.4) We see that if there is no displacement, there is no work done even if the force is large. Thus, when you push hard against a rigid brick wall, the force you exert on the wall does no work. Yet your muscles are alternatively contracting and relaxing and internal energy is being used up and you do get tired."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 143, "content": "Thus, the meaning of work in physics is different from its usage in everyday language. No work is done if : (i) the displacement is zero as seen in the example above. A weightlifter holding a 150 kg mass steadily on his shoulder for 30 s does no work on the load during this time. (ii) the force is zero. A block moving on a smooth horizontal table is not acted upon by a horizontal force (since there is no friction), but may undergo a large displacement. (iii) the force and displacement are mutually perpendicular. This is so since, for \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 rad (= 90o), cos (\u03c0/2) = 0. For the block moving on a smooth horizontal table, the gravitational force mg does no work since it acts at right angles to the displacement. If we assume that the moon\u2019s orbits around the earth is perfectly circular then the earth\u2019s gravitational force does no work. The moon\u2019s instantaneous displacement is tangential while the earth\u2019s force is radially inwards and \u03b8 = \u03c0/2. Work can be both positive and negative. If \u03b8 is between 0o and 90o, cos \u03b8 in Eq. (5.4) is positive. If \u03b8 is between 90o and 180o, cos \u03b8 is negative. In many examples the frictional force opposes displacement and \u03b8 = 180o. Then the work done by friction is negative (cos 180o = \u20131). From Eq. (5.4) it is clear that work and energy have the same dimensions, [ML2T\u20132]. The SI unit of these is joule (J), named after the famous British physicist James Prescott Joule (1811-1869). Since work and energy are so widely used as physical concepts, alternative units abound and some of these are listed in Table 5.1."}

The term potential energy brings to one\u2019s mind \u2018stored\u2019 energy. A stretched bow-string possesses potential energy. When it is released, the arrow flies off at a great speed. The earth\u2019s crust is not uniform, but has discontinuities and dislocations that are called fault lines. These fault lines in the earth\u2019s crust are like \u2018compressed springs\u2019. They possess a large amount of potential energy. An earthquake results when these fault lines readjust. Thus, potential energy is the \u2018stored energy\u2019 by virtue of the position or configuration of a body. The body left to itself releases this stored energy in the form of kinetic energy. Let us make our notion of potential energy more concrete. The gravitational force on a ball of mass m is mg . g may be treated as a constant near the earth surface. By \u2018near\u2019 we imply that the height h of the ball above the earth\u2019s surface is very small compared to the earth\u2019s radius RE (h <<RE) so that we can ignore the variation of g near the earth\u2019s surface*."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 149, "content": "In what follows we have taken the upward direction to be positive. Let us raise the ball up to a height h. The work done by the external agency against the gravitational force is mgh. This work gets stored as potential energy. Gravitational potential energy of an object, as a function of the height h, is denoted by V(h) and it is the negative of work done by the gravitational force in raising the object to that height. V (h) = mgh If h is taken as a variable, it is easily seen that the gravitational force F equals the negative of the derivative of V(h) with respect to h. Thus, d d F V(h) m g h = \u2212 = \u2212 The negative sign indicates that the gravitational force is downward. When released, the ball comes down with an increasing speed. Just before it hits the ground, its speed is given by the kinematic relation, v2 = 2gh This equation can be written as 2 1 m v2 = m g h which shows that the gravitational potential energy of the object at height h, when the object is released, manifests itself as kinetic energy of the object on reaching the ground. Physically, the notion of potential energy is applicable only to the class of forces where work done against the force gets \u2018stored up\u2019 as energy.

In the previous chapter we have worked on examples dealing with inclined planes. If an object of mass m is released from rest, from the top of a smooth (frictionless) inclined plane of height h, its speed at the bottom is gh 2 irrespective of the angle of inclination. Thus, at the bottom of the inclined plane it acquires a kinetic energy, mgh. If the work done or the kinetic energy did depend on other factors such as the velocity or the particular path taken by the object, the force would be called non- conservative. The dimensions of potential energy are [ML2T \u20132] and the unit is joule (J), the same as kinetic energy or work.

Individually the kinetic energy K and the potential energy V(x) may vary from point to point, but the sum is a constant. The aptness of the term \u2018conservative force\u2019 is now clear. Let us consider some of the definitions of a conservative force. l A force F(x) is conservative if it can be derived from a scalar quantity V(x) by the relation given by Eq. (5.9). The three-dimensional generalisation requires the use of a vector derivative, which is outside the scope of this book. l The work done by the conservative force depends only on the end points. This can be seen from the relation, W = Kf \u2013 Ki = V (xi) \u2013 V(xf) which depends on the end points. l A third definition states that the work done by this force in a closed path is zero. This is once again apparent from Eq. (5.11) since xi = xf . Thus, the principle of conservation of total mechanical energy can be stated as The total mechanical energy of a system is conserved if the forces, doing work on it, are conservative."}

The latter does no work since the displacement of the bob is always normal to the string. The potential energy of the bob is thus associated with the gravitational force only.

Fig. 5.7 shows a block attached to a spring and resting on a smooth horizontal surface. The other end of the spring is attached to a rigid wall. The spring is light and may be treated as massless. In an ideal spring, the spring force Fs is proportional to x where x is the displacement of the block from the equilibrium position. The displacement could be either positive [Fig. 5.7(b)] or negative [Fig. 5.7(c)].

(i) Information on time is absent from the above discussions. In the example considered above, we can calculate the compression, but not the time over which the compression occurs. A solution of Newton\u2019s Second Law for this system is required for temporal information. (ii) Not all forces are conservative. Friction, for example, is a non-conservative force. The principle of conservation of energy will have to be modified in this case. This is illustrated in Example 5.9. (iii) The zero of the potential energy is arbitrary. It is set according to convenience. For the spring force we took V(x) = 0, at x = 0, i.e. the unstretched spring had zero potential energy. For the constant gravitational force mg, we took V = 0 on the earth\u2019s surface. In a later chapter we shall see that for the force due to the universal law of gravitation, the zero is best defined at an infinite distance from the gravitational source.

Example 5.9 Consider Example 5.8 taking the coefficient of friction, \u00b5, to be 0.5 and calculate the maximum compression of the spring. Answer In presence of friction, both the spring force and the frictional force act so as to oppose the compression of the spring as shown in Fig. 5.9.

One can argue this as follows. When two objects collide, the mutual impulsive forces acting over the collision time \u2206t cause a change in their respective momenta : \u2206p1 = F12 \u2206t \u2206p2 = F21 \u2206t where F12 is the force exerted on the first particle by the second particle. F21 is likewise the force exerted on the second particle by the first particle. Now from Newton\u2019s third law, F12 = \u2212 F21. This implies \u2206p1 + \u2206p2 = 0 The above conclusion is true even though the forces vary in a complex fashion during the collision time \u2206t. Since the third law is true at every instant, the total impulse on the first object is equal and opposite to that on the second. On the other hand, the total kinetic energy of the system is not necessarily conserved. The impact and deformation during collision may generate heat and sound. Part of the initial kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy. A useful way to visualise the deformation during collision is in terms of a \u2018compressed spring\u2019. If the \u2018spring\u2019 connecting the two masses regains its original shape without loss in energy, then the initial kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy but the kinetic energy during the collision time \u2206t is not constant.

The work-energy theorem states that the change in kinetic energy of a body is the work done by the net force on the body. Kf - Ki = Wnet 2. A force is conservative if (i) work done by it on an object is path independent and depends only on the end points {xi, xj}, or (ii) the work done by the force is zero for an arbitrary closed path taken by the object such that it returns to its initial position. 3.

The WE theorem is not independent of Newton\u2019s Second Law. The WE theorem may be viewed as a scalar form of the Second Law.

It can also be extended to non- inertial frames provided we include the pseudoforces in the calculation of the net force acting on the body under consideration. 7. The potential energy of a body subjected to a conservative force is always undetermined upto a constant. For example, the point where the potential energy is zero is a matter of choice. For the gravitational potential energy mgh, the zero of the potential energy is chosen to be the ground. For the spring potential energy kx2/2 , the zero of the potential energy is the equilibrium position of the oscillating mass. 8. Every force encountered in mechanics does not have an associated potential energy. For example, work done by friction over a closed path is not zero and no potential energy can be associated with friction. 9.

(A particle is ideally represented as a point mass having no size.) We applied the results of our study even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming that motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the motion of a particle. Any real body which we encounter in daily life has a finite size. In dealing with the motion of extended bodies (bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is inadequate. In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this inadequacy. We shall attempt to build an understanding of the motion of extended bodies. An extended body, in the first place, is a system of particles. We shall begin with the consideration of motion of the system as a whole. The centre of mass of a system of particles will be a key concept here. We shall discuss the motion of the centre of mass of a system of particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding the motion of extended bodies. A large class of problems with extended bodies can be solved by considering them to be rigid bodies. Ideally a rigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and unchanging shape. The distances between all pairs of particles of such a body do not change. It is evident from this definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid, since real bodies deform under the influence of forces. But in many situations the deformations are negligible."}

We know from experience that the axis of such a spinning top moves around the vertical through its point of contact with the ground, sweeping out a cone as shown in Fig. 6.5(a). (This movement of the axis of the top around the vertical is termed precession.) Note, the point of contact of the top with ground is fixed.

The net contribution of every such pair to the integral and hence the integral itself is zero. From Eq. (6.6), the point for which the integral itself is zero, is the centre of mass. Thus, the centre of mass of a homogenous thin rod coincides with its geometric centre. This can be understood on the basis of reflection symmetry. The same symmetry argument will apply to homogeneous rings, discs, spheres, or even thick rods of circular or rectangular cross section.

(6.9) may be written as 1 2 ... n M = + + + A F F F (6.10) Thus, the total mass of a system of particles times the acceleration of its centre of mass is the vector sum of all the forces acting on the system of particles. Note when we talk of the force 1 F on the first particle, it is not a single force, but the vector sum of all the forces on the first particle; likewise for the second particle etc. Among these forces on each particle there will be external forces exerted by bodies outside the system and also internal forces exerted by the particles on one another. We know from Newton\u2019s third law that these internal forces occur in equal and opposite pairs and in the sum of forces of Eq. (6.10), their contribution is zero. Only the external forces contribute to the equation. We can then rewrite Eq. (6.10) as ext M = A F (6.11) where ext F represents the sum of all external forces acting on the particles of the system. Eq.

{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 193, "content": "To obtain Eq. (6.11) we did not need to specify the nature of the system of particles. The system may be a collection of particles in which there may be all kinds of internal motions, or it may be a rigid body which has either pure translational motion or a combination of translational and rotational motion. Whatever is the system and the motion of its individual particles, the centre of mass moves according to Eq. (6.11). Instead of treating extended bodies as single particles as we have done in earlier chapters, we can now treat them as systems of particles. We can obtain the translational component of their motion, i.e. the motion of the centre of mass of the system, by taking the mass of the whole system to be concentrated at the centre of mass and all the external forces on the system to be acting at the centre of mass. This is the procedure that we followed earlier in analysing forces on bodies and solving Reprint 2025-26 100 PHYSICS problems without explicitly outlining and justifying the procedure. We now realise that in earlier studies we assumed, without saying so, that rotational motion and/or internal motion of the particles were either absent or negligible. We no longer need to do this. We have not only found the justification of the procedure we followed earlier; but we also have found how to describe and separate the translational motion of (1) a rigid body which may be rotating as well, or (2) a system of particles with all kinds of internal motion.

The centre of mass under the influence of the external force continues, therefore, along the same parabolic trajectory as it would have followed if there were no explosion. 6.4 LINEAR MOMENTUM OF A SYSTEM OF PARTICLES Let us recall that the linear momentum of a particle is defined as m = p v (6.12) Let us also recall that Newton\u2019s second law written in symbolic form for a single particle is d dt = p F (6.13) where F is the force on the particle. Let us consider a system of n particles with masses m1, m2,...mn respectively and velocities 1 2 , ,....... n v v v respectively. The particles may be interacting and have external forces acting on them. The linear momentum of the first particle is 1 1 m v , of the second particle is 2 2 m v and so on.

Suppose now, that the sum of external forces acting on a system of particles is zero. Then from Eq. (6.17) or d 0 dt = P P = Constant (6.18a) Thus, when the total external force acting on a system of particles is zero, the total linear momentum of the system is constant. This is the law of conservation of the total linear momentum of a system of particles. Because of Eq. (6.15), this also means that when the total external force on the system is zero the velocity of the centre of mass remains constant. (We assume throughout the discussion on systems of particles in this chapter that the total mass of the system remains constant.) Note that on account of the internal forces, i.e. the forces exerted by the particles on one another, the individual particles may have Reprint 2025-26 SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 101 complicated trajectories. Yet, if the total external force acting on the system is zero, the centre of mass moves with a constant velocity, i.e., moves uniformly in a straight line like a free particle. The vector Eq.

As an example, let us consider the radioactive decay of a moving unstable particle, like the nucleus of radium. A radium nucleus disintegrates into a nucleus of radon and an alpha particle. The forces leading to the decay are internal to the system and the external forces on the system are negligible. So the total linear momentum of the system is the same before and after decay. The two particles produced in the decay, the radon nucleus and the alpha particle, move in different directions in such a way that their centre of mass moves along the same path along which the original decaying radium nucleus was moving [Fig. 6.13(a)]. If we observe the decay from the frame of reference in which the centre of mass is at rest, the motion of the particles involved in the decay looks particularly simple; the product particles move back to back with their centre of mass remaining at rest as shown in Fig.6.13 (b). In many problems on the system of particles, as in the above radioactive decay problem, it is convenient to work in the centre of mass frame rather than in the laboratory frame of reference. In astronomy, binary (double) stars is a common occurrence. If there are no external forces, the centre of mass of a double star moves like a free particle, as shown in Fig.6.14 (a)."}

Thus in our frame of reference, the trajectories of the stars are a combination of (i) uniform motion in a straight line of the centre of mass and (ii) circular orbits of the stars about the centre of mass. As can be seen from the two examples, separating the motion of different parts of a system into motion of the centre of mass and motion about the centre of mass is a very useful technique that helps in understanding the motion of the system. 6.5 VECTOR PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS We are already familiar with vectors and their use in physics.

(A particle (P) of the rigid body rotating about the fixed (z-) axis moves in a circle with centre (C) on the axis.) which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its centre on the axis. In Fig. 6.16 we redraw Fig. 6.4, showing a typical particle (at a point P) of the rigid body rotating about a fixed axis (taken as the z-axis). The particle describes Reprint 2025-26 104 PHYSICS a circle with a centre C on the axis. The radius of the circle is r, the perpendicular distance of the point P from the axis. We also show the linear velocity vector v of the particle at P. It is along the tangent at P to the circle. Let P\u2032 be the position of the particle after an interval of time \u2206t (Fig. 6.16). The angle PCP\u2032 describes the angular displacement \u2206\u03b8 of the particle in time \u2206t. The average angular velocity of the particle over the interval \u2206t is \u2206\u03b8/\u2206t. As \u2206t tends to zero (i.e. takes smaller and smaller values), the ratio \u2206\u03b8/\u2206t approaches a limit which is the instantaneous angular velocity d\u03b8/dt of the particle at the position P. We denote the instantaneous angular velocity by \u03c9 (the Greek letter omega)."}

We observe that at any given instant the relation v r \u03c9 = applies to all particles of the rigid body. Thus for a particle at a perpendicular distance ri from the fixed axis, the linear velocity at a given instant vi is given by i i v r \u03c9 = (6.19) The index i runs from 1 to n, where n is the total number of particles of the body. For particles on the axis, 0 = r , and hence v = \u03c9 r = 0. Thus, particles on the axis are stationary. This verifies that the axis is fixed. Note that we use the same angular velocity \u03c9 for all the particles. We therefore, refer to \u03c9 as the angular velocity of the whole body. We have characterised pure translation of a body by all parts of the body having the same velocity at any instant of time. Similarly, we may characterise pure rotation by all parts of the body having the same angular velocity at any instant of time. Note that this characterisation of the rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis is just another way of saying as in Sec. 6.1 that each particle of the body moves in a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has the centre on the axis.

Analogous to the kinetic variables of linear displacement (s) and velocity (v) in translational motion, we have angular displacement (\u03b8) and angular velocity (\u03c9) in rotational motion. It is then natural to define in rotational motion the concept of angular acceleration in analogy with linear acceleration defined as the time rate of change of velocity in translational motion. We define angular acceleration \u03b1 as the time rate of change of angular velocity.

These as we shall see, are especially important in the discussion of motion of systems of particles, particularly rigid bodies. 6.7.1 Moment of force (Torque) We have learnt that the motion of a rigid body, in general, is a combination of rotation and translation. If the body is fixed at a point or along a line, it has only rotational motion. We know that force is needed to change the translational state of a body, i.e. to produce linear acceleration. We may then ask, what is the analogue of force in the case of rotational motion? To look into the question in a concrete situation let us take the example of opening or closing of a door."}

It is clear that unless a force is applied the door does not rotate. But any force does not do the job. A force applied to the hinge line cannot produce any rotation at all, whereas a force of given magnitude applied at right angles to the door at its outer edge is most effective in producing rotation. It is not the force alone, but how and where the force is applied is important in rotational motion. The rotational analogue of force in linear motion is moment of force. It is also referred to as torque or couple. (We shall use the words moment of force and torque interchangeably.) We shall first define the moment of force for the special case of a single particle. Later on we shall extend the concept to systems of particles including rigid bodies.

Another known example is a compass needle in the earth\u2019s magnetic field as shown in the Fig. 6.21(b). The earth\u2019s magnetic field exerts equal forces on the north and south poles. The force on the North Pole is towards the north, and the force on the South Pole is toward the south. Except when the needle points in the north-south direction; the two forces do not have the same line of action. Thus there is a couple acting on the needle due to the earth\u2019s magnetic field. Fig. 6.21(a) Our fingers apply a couple to turn the lid.

Answer Fig. 6.22 Consider a couple as shown in Fig. 6.22 acting on a rigid body. The forces F and -F act respectively at points B and A.

This point is called the fulcrum. A see- saw on the children\u2019s playground is a typical example of a lever. Two forces F1 and F2, parallel to each other and usually perpendicular to the lever, as shown here, act on the lever at distances d1 and d2 respectively from the fulcrum as shown in Fig. 6.23. Fig. 6.23 The lever is a system in mechanical equilibrium. Let R be the reaction of the support at the fulcrum; R is directed opposite to the forces F1 and F2. For translational equilibrium, R \u2013 F1 \u2013 F2 = 0 (i) For considering rotational equilibrium we take the moments about the fulcrum; the sum of moments must be zero, d1F1 \u2013 d2F2 = 0 (ii) Normally the anticlockwise (clockwise) moments are taken to be positive (negative). Note R acts at the fulcrum itself and has zero moment about the fulcrum. In the case of the lever force F1 is usually some weight to be lifted. It is called the load and its distance from the fulcrum d1 is called the load arm."}

(ii) can be written as d1F1 = d2 F2 (6.32a) or load arm \u00d7 load = effort arm \u00d7 effort The above equation expresses the principle of moments for a lever. Incidentally the ratio F1/F2 is called the Mechanical Advantage (M.A. ); M.A. = 1 2 2 1 F d F d = (6.32b) If the effort arm d2 is larger than the load arm, the mechanical advantage is greater than one. Mechanical advantage greater than one means that a small effort can be used to lift a large load. There are several examples of a lever around you besides the see-saw. The beam of a balance is a lever. Try to find more such Reprint 2025-26 112 PHYSICS examples and identify the fulcrum, the effort and effort arm, and the load and the load arm of the lever in each case. You may easily show that the principle of moment holds even when the parallel forces F1 and F2 are not perpendicular, but act at some angle, to the lever. 6.8.2 Centre of gravity Many of you may have the experience of balancing your notebook on the tip of a finger. Figure 6.24 illustrates a similar experiment that you can easily perform. Take an irregular- shaped cardboard having mass M and a narrow tipped object like a pencil. You can locate by trial and error a point G on the cardboard where it can be balanced on the tip of the pencil. (The cardboard remains horizontal in this position.) This point of balance is the centre of gravity (CG) of the cardboard."}

As shown in the Fig. 6.24, the reaction of the tip is equal and opposite to Mg and hence the cardboard is in translational equilibrium. It is also in rotational equilibrium; if it were not so, due to the unbalanced torque it would tilt and fall. There are torques on the card board due to the forces of gravity like m1g, m2g \u2026. etc, acting on the individual particles that make up the cardboard.

The CG of the cardboard is so located that the total torque on it due to the forces m1g, m2g \u2026. etc. is zero. If ri is the position vector of the ith particle of an extended body with respect to its CG, then the torque about the CG, due to the force of gravity on the particle is \u03c4i = ri \u00d7 mi g.

We note that this is true because the body being small, g does not vary from one point of the body to the other. If the body is so extended that g varies from part to part of the body, then the centre of gravity and centre of mass will not coincide. Basically, the two are different concepts. The centre of mass has nothing to do with gravity. It depends only on the distribution of mass of the body. In Sec. 6.2 we found out the position of the centre of mass of several regular, homogeneous objects. Obviously the method used there gives us also the centre of gravity of these bodies, if they are small enough. Figure 6.25 illustrates another way of determining the CG of an irregular shaped body like a cardboard. If you suspend the body from some point like A, the vertical line through A passes through the CG. We mark the vertical AA1. We then suspend the body through other points like B and C. The intersection of the verticals gives the CG. Explain why the method works. Since the body is small enough, the method allows us to determine also its centre of mass.

We have yet to answer one major question in this connection. What is the analogue of mass in rotational motion? We shall attempt to answer this question in the present section. To keep the discussion simple, we shall consider rotation about a fixed axis only. Let us try to get an expression for the kinetic energy of a rotating body. We know that for a body rotating about a fixed axis, each particle of the body moves in a circle with linear velocity given by Eq. (6.19). (Refer to Fig. 6.16). For a particle at a distance from the axis, the linear velocity is i ir \u03c5 \u03c9 = ."}

Similarly, as the moment of inertia about a given axis of rotation resists a change in its rotational motion, it can be regarded as a measure of rotational inertia of the body; it is a measure of the way in which different parts of the body are distributed at different distances from the axis. Unlike the mass of a body, the moment of inertia is not a fixed quantity but depends on distribution of mass about the axis of rotation, and the orientation and position of the axis of rotation with respect to the body as a whole. As a measure of the way in which the mass of a rotating rigid body is distributed with respect to the axis of rotation, we can define a new parameter, the radius of gyration. It is related to the moment of inertia and the total mass of the body. Notice from the Table 6.1 that in all cases, we can write I = Mk2, where k has the dimension of length. For a rod, about the perpendicular axis at its midpoint, i.e. 2 2 12, k L = = 12 k L . Similarly, k = R/2 for the circular disc about its diameter. The length k is a geometric property of the body and axis of rotation. It is called the radius of gyration.

The property of this extremely important quantity I, as a measure of rotational inertia of the body, has been put to a great practical use.

Only these components can cause the body to rotate about the axis. A component of the torque perpendicular to the axis of rotation will tend to turn the axis from its position. We specifically assume that there will arise necessary forces of constraint to cancel the effect of the perpendicular components of the (external) torques, so that the fixed position of the axis will be maintained. The perpendicular components of the torques, therefore need not be taken into account.

Observations since early times recognised stars which appeared in the sky with positions unchanged year after year. The more interesting objects are the planets which seem to have regular motions against the background of stars. The earliest recorded model for planetary motions proposed by Ptolemy about 2000 years ago was a \u2018geocentric\u2019 model in which all celestial objects, stars, the sun and the planets, all revolved around the earth. The only motion that was thought to be possible for celestial objects was motion in a circle. Complicated schemes of motion were put forward by Ptolemy in order to describe the observed motion of the planets. The planets were described as moving in circles with the centre of the circles themselves moving in larger circles. Similar theories were also advanced by Indian astronomers some 400 years later. However a more elegant model in which the Sun was the centre around which the planets revolved \u2013 the \u2018heliocentric\u2019 model \u2013 was already mentioned by Aryabhatta (5th century A.D.) in his treatise."}

Join the points F1 and F2 and extend the line to intersect the ellipse at points P and A as shown in Fig. 7.1(b).

In considering motion of an object under the gravitational influence of another object the following quantities are conserved: (a) Angular momentum (b) Total mechanical energy Linear momentum is not conserved 2. Angular momentum conservation leads to Kepler\u2019s second law. However, it is not special to the inverse square law of gravitation. It holds for any central force. 3. In Kepler\u2019s third law (see Eq. (7.1) and T2 = KS R3. The constant KS is the same for all planets in circular orbits. This applies to satellites orbiting the Earth [(Eq. (7.38)]. 4. An astronaut experiences weightlessness in a space satellite. This is not because the gravitational force is small at that location in space. It is because both the astronaut and the satellite are in \u201cfree fall\u201d towards the Earth. 5. The gravitational potential energy associated with two particles separated by a distance r is given by V G m m r = + \u2013 1 2 constant The constant can be given any value.

Choosing location of zero of the gravitational energy is the same as choosing the arbitrary constant in the potential energy.

Although the gravitational force between two particles is central, the force between two finite rigid bodies is not necessarily along the line joining their centre of mass. For a spherically symmetric body however the force on a particle external to the body is as if the mass is concentrated at the centre and this force is therefore central. 9.

These abbreviations in the text are written in ordinary normal/roman (upright) type. \u2022 Vectors are printed in bold and normal/roman (upright) type.

The shorter designations for units such as kg, m, s, cd, etc., are symbols and not the abbreviations. The unit names are never capitalised. However, the unit symbols are capitalised only if the symbol for a unit is derived from a proper name of scientist, beginning with a capital, normal/roman letter. For example, m for the unit \u2018metre\u2019, d for the unit \u2018day\u2019, atm for the unit \u2018atmospheric pressure\u2019, Hz for the unit \u2018hertz\u2019, Wb for the unit \u2018weber\u2019, J for the unit \u2018joule\u2019, A for the unit \u2018ampere\u2019, V for the unit \u2018volt\u2019, etc. The single exception is L, which is the symbol for the unit \u2018litre\u2019. This exception is made to avoid confusion of the lower case letter l with the Arabic numeral l. \u2022 Symbols for units do not contain any final full stop at the end of recommended letter and remain unaltered in the plural, using only singular form of the unit. For example, for a length of 25 centimetres the unit symbol is written as 25 cm and not 25 cms or 25 cm. or 25 cms., etc."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 302, "content": "\u2022 Use of solidus ( / ) is recommended only for indicating a division of one letter unit symbol by another unit symbol. Not more than one solidus is used. For example : m/s2 or m s\u20132 (with a spacing between m and s\u20132) but not m/s/s; 1 Pl =1 N s m \u20132 = 1 N s/m2 = 1 kg/s m=1 kg m\u20131 s\u20131, but not 1 kg/m/s; J/K mol or J K\u20131 mol\u20131, but not J/K/mol; etc. \u2022 Prefix symbols are printed in normal/roman (upright) type without spacing between the prefix symbol and the unit symbol. Thus certain approved prefixes written very close to the unit symbol are used to indicate decimal fractions or multiples of a SI unit, when it is inconveniently small or large. For example : megawatt ( 1MW = 106 W); nanosecond (1 ns = 10\u20139 s); centimetre (1 cm = 10\u20132 m); picofarad (1 pF = 10\u201312 F);. kilometre ( 1 km = 103 m); microsecond (1\u00b5s = 10\u20136 s); millivolt (1 mV= 10\u20133 V); gigahertz (1GHz = 109 Hz); Reprint 2025-26 153 APPENDICES kilowatt-hour (1 kW h = 103 W h = 3.6 MJ = 3.6 \u00d7 106 J); microampere (1\u00b5 A = 10\u20136 A); micron (1\u00b5m = 10\u20136 m); angstrom (1 \u0391\u00b0 =0.1 nm = 10\u201310 m); etc. The unit \u2018micron\u2019 which equals 10\u20136 m, i.e. a micrometre, is simply the name given to convenient sub-multiple of the metre. In the same spirit, the unit \u2018fermi\u2019, equal to a femtometre or 10\u201315 m has been used as the convenient length unit in nuclear studies. Similarly, the unit \u2018barn\u2019, equal to 10\u201328 m2, is a convenient measure of cross-sectional areas in sub-atomic particle collisions."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 303, "content": "However, the unit \u2018micron\u2019 is preferred over the unit \u2018micrometre\u2019 to avoid confusion of the \u2018micrometre\u2019 with the length measuring instrument called \u2018micrometer\u2019. These newly formed multiples or sub-multiples (cm, km, \u00b5m, \u00b5s, ns) of SI units, metre and second, constitute a new composite inseparable symbol for units. \u2022 When a prefix is placed before the symbol of a unit, the combination of prefix and symbol is considered as a new symbol, for the unit, which can be raised to a positive or negative power without using brackets. These can be combined with other unit symbols to form compound unit. Rules for binding-in indices are not those of ordinary algebra. For example : cm3 means always (cm)3 = (0.01 m)3 = (10\u20132 m)3 = 10\u20136 m3, but never 0.01 m3 or 10\u20132 m3 or 1cm3 (prefix c with a spacing with m3 is meaningless as prefix c is to be attached to a unit symbol and it has no physical significance or independent existence without attachment with a unit symbol). Similarly, mA2 means always (mA)2= (0.001A)2 = (10\u20133 A)2 =10\u20136 A2, but never 0.001 A2 or 10\u20133 A2 or m A2; 1 cm\u20131 = (10\u20132m)\u20131=102 m\u20131, but not 1c m\u20131 or 10\u20132 m\u20131; 1\u00b5s\u20131 means always (10\u20136s)\u20131=106 s\u20131, but not 1 \u00d7 10\u20136 s\u20131; 1 km2 means always (km)2 = (103 m)2=106 m2, but not 103 m2; 1mm2 means always (mm)2= (10\u20133 m)2=10\u20136 m2, but not 10\u20133 m2. \u2022 A prefix is never used alone. It is always attached to a unit symbol and written or fixed before (pre-fix) the unit symbol. For example : 103/m3 means 1000/m3 or 1000 m-3, but not k/m3 or k m-3."}

For example : m s-1 (symbols m and s\u20131, in lower case, small letter m and s, are separate and independent unit symbols for metre and second respectively, with spacing between them) means \u2018metre per second\u2019, but not \u2018milli per second\u2019. Similarly, ms\u20131 [symbol m and s are written very close to each other, with prefix symbol m (for prefix milli) and unit symbol s, in lower case, small letter (for unit \u2018second\u2019) without any spacing between them and making ms as a new composite unit] means \u2018per millisecond\u2019, but never \u2018metre per second\u2019. mS\u20131[symbol m and S are written very close to each other, with prefix symbol m (for prefix milli) and unit symbol S, in capital roman letter S (for unit \u2018siemens\u2019) without any spacing between them, and making mS as a new composite unit] means \u2018per millisiemens\u2019, but never \u2018per millisecond\u2019. C m [symbol C and m are written separately, representing unit symbols C (for unit \u2018coulomb\u2019) and m (for unit \u2018metre\u2019), with spacing between them] means \u2018coulomb metre\u2019, but never \u2018centimetre\u2019, etc. \u2022 The use of double prefixes is avoided when single prefixes are available. For example : Reprint 2025-26 154 PHYSICS 10\u20139 m = 1nm (nanometre), but not 1m\u00b5m (millimicrometre), 10\u20136 m= 1\u00b5m (micron), but not 1mmm(millimillimetre), 10\u201312 F= 1 pF (picofarad), but not 1\u00b5\u00b5F (micromicrofarad), 109 W=1 GW (giga watt), but not 1 kMW (kilomegawatt), etc. \u2022 The use of a combination of unit and the symbols for units is avoided when the physical quantity is expressed by combining two or more units."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 305, "content": "For example : joule per mole kelvin is written as J/mol K or J mol\u20131 K\u20131, but not joule/mole K or J/ mol kelvin or J/mole K, etc. joule per tesla is written as J/T or J T\u20131, but not joule /T or J per tesla or J/tesla, etc. newton metre second is written as N m s, but not Newton m second or N m second or N metre s or newton metre s, etc. joule per kilogram kelvin is written as J/kg K or J kg\u20131 K\u20131, but not J/kilog K or joule/kg K or J/ kg kelvin or J/kilogram K, etc. \u2022 To simplify calculations, the prefix symbol is attached to the unit symbol in the numerator and not to the denominator. For example : 106 N/m2 is written more conveniently as MN/m2, in preference to N/mm2. A preference has been expressed for multiples or sub-multiples involving the factor 1000, 10+3n where n is the integer. \u2022 Proper care is needed when same symbols are used for physical quantities and units of physical quantities. For example : The physical quantity weight (W) expressed as a product of mass (m) and acceleration due to gravity (g) may be written in terms of symbols W, m and g printed in italic ( or sloping) type as W = m g, preferably with a spacing between m and g. It should not be confused with the unit symbols for the units watt (W), metre (m) and gram (g). However, in the equation W=m g, the symbol W expresses the weight with a unit symbol J, m as the mass with a unit symbol kg and g as the acceleration due to gravity with a unit symbol m/s2."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_1.pdf", "chunk_id": 306, "content": "Similarly, in equation F = m a, the symbol F expresses the force with a unit symbol N, m as the mass with a unit symbol kg, and a as the acceleration with a unit symbol m/s2. These symbols for physical quantities should not be confused with the unit symbols for the units \u2018farad\u2019 (F), \u2018metre\u2019(m) and \u2018are\u2019 (a). Proper distinction must be made while using the symbols h (prefix hecto, and unit hour), c (prefix centi, and unit carat), d (prefix deci and unit day), T (prefix tera, and unit tesla), a (prefix atto, and unit are), da (prefix deca, and unit deciare), etc. \u2022 SI base unit \u2018kilogram\u2019 for mass is formed by attaching SI prefix (a multiple equal to 103) \u2018kilo\u2019 to a cgs (centimetre, gram, second) unit \u2018gram\u2019 and this may seem to result in an anomaly. Thus, while a thousandth part of unit of length (metre) is called a millimetre (mm), a thousandth part of the unit of mass (kg) is not called a millikilogram, but just a gram. This appears to give the impression that the unit of mass is a gram (g) which is not true. Such a situation has arisen because we are unable to replace the name \u2018kilogram\u2019 by any other suitable unit. Therefore, as an exception, name of the multiples and sub-multiples of the unit of mass are formed by attaching prefixes to the word \u2018gram\u2019 and not to the word \u2018kilogram\u2019. For example : 103 kg =1 megagram ( 1Mg), but not 1 kilo kilogram (1 kkg); 10\u20136 kg = 1 milligram ( 1 mg), but not 1 microkilogram ( 1\u00b5kg); 10\u20133 kg = 1 gram (1g), but not 1 millikilogram (1 mkg), etc."}
