Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the burning of magnesium in air. 1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.

Metals such as potassium and sodium react so\nvigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them\nand to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil. At ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium,\naluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The\nprotective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron\ndoes not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled\nin the flame of the burner. Copper does not burn, but the hot metal is\ncoated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do\nnot react with oxygen even at high temperatures. Do You Know? Anodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium\ndevelops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air. This aluminium oxide coat makes it\nresistant to further corrosion. The resistance can be improved further by making the\noxide layer thicker. During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode\nand is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode\nreacts with aluminium to make a thicker protective oxide layer. This oxide layer can\nbe dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish. After performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium\nis the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of\nmagnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium. But burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of\nzinc, iron, copper or lead.

Galvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting\nby coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is\nprotected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you\nreason this out? Alloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal. We can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is\nthe most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is\nbecause pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is\nmixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard\nand strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get\nstainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed\nwith some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties\nof any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance. The substance added may be a metal or a non-metal.

We also\nReprint 2025-26\nCarbon and its Compounds\n59\nsaw how the nature of bonding in ionic compounds explains these\nproperties. Let us now study the properties of some carbon compounds. Most carbon compounds are poor conductors of electricity as we\nhave seen in Chapter 2. From the data\ngiven in Table 4.1 on the boiling and\nmelting points of the carbon compounds,\nwe find that these compounds have low\nmelting and boiling points as compared\nto ionic compounds (Chapter 3). We can\nconclude that the forces of attraction\nbetween the molecules are not very\nstrong. Since these compounds are\nlargely non-conductors of electricity, we\ncan conclude that the bonding in these\ncompounds does not give rise to any ions. In Class IX, we learnt about the\ncombining capacity of various elements and how it depends on the\nnumber of valence electrons. Let us now look at the electronic\nconfiguration of carbon. The atomic number of carbon is 6. What would\nbe the distribution of electrons in various shells of carbon? How many\nvalence electrons will carbon have? We know that the reactivity of elements is explained as their tendency\nto attain a completely filled outer shell, that is, attain noble gas\nconfiguration. Elements forming ionic compounds achieve this by either\ngaining or losing electrons from the outermost shell."}

No other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent\nseen in carbon compounds.

Most dirt is\noily in nature and as you know, oil does not dissolve in water. The\nmolecules of soap are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic\nacids. The ionic-end of soap interacts with water while the carbon chain\ninteracts with oil. The soap molecules, thus form structures called\nmicelles (see Fig. 4.12) where one end of the molecules is towards the oil\ndroplet while the ionic-end faces outside. This forms an emulsion in\nwater. The soap micelle thus helps  in pulling out the dirt in water and\nwe can wash our clothes clean (Fig. 4.13). Can you draw the structure of the micelle that would be formed if\nyou dissolve soap in a hydrocarbon? Micelles\nSoaps are molecules in which the two ends have differing properties, one is hydrophilic,\nthat is, it interacts with water, while the other end is hydrophobic, that is, it interacts\nwith hydrocarbons. When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic \u2018tail\u2019 of soap\nwill not be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the\nionic end in water and the hydrocarbon \u2018tail\u2019 protruding out of water.

But a plant that is not visibly growing is\nstill alive, and some animals can breathe without visible movement. So\nusing visible movement as the defining characteristic of life is not enough. Movements over very small scales will be invisible to the naked eye \u2013\nmovements of molecules, for example. Is this invisible molecular\nmovement necessary for life? If we ask this question to professional\nbiologists, they will say yes.

Even when we are just sitting in\nReprint 2025-26\nScience\n80\nclass, even if we are just asleep, this maintenance job has to go on. The processes which together perform this maintenance job are\nlife processes. Since these maintenance processes are needed to prevent damage\nand break-down, energy is needed for them. This energy comes from\noutside the body of the individual organism. So there must be a process\nto transfer a source of energy from outside the body of the organism,\nwhich we call food, to the inside, a process we commonly call nutrition. If the body size of the organisms is to grow, additional raw material will\nalso be needed from outside. Since life on earth depends on carbon-\nbased molecules, most of these food sources are also carbon-based. Depending on the complexity of these carbon sources, different\norganisms can then use different kinds of nutritional processes. The outside sources of energy could be quite varied, since the\nenvironment is not under the control of the individual organism. These\nsources of energy, therefore, need to be broken down or built up in the\nbody, and must be finally converted to a uniform source of energy that\ncan be used for the various molecular movements needed for\nmaintaining living structures, as well as to the kind of molecules the\nbody needs to grow. For this, a series of chemical reactions in the\nbody are necessary. Oxidising-reducing reactions are some of the most\ncommon chemical means to break-down molecules.

In the case of a single-celled organism, no specific organs for taking\nin food, exchange of gases or removal of wastes may be needed because\nthe entire surface of the organism is in contact with the environment. But what happens when the body size of the organism increases and\nthe body design becomes more complex? In multi-cellular organisms,\nall the cells may not be in direct contact with the surrounding\nenvironment. Thus, simple diffusion will not meet the requirements of\nall the cells. We have seen previously how, in multi-cellular organisms, various\nbody parts have specialised in the functions they perform. We are familiar\nwith the idea of these specialised tissues, and with their organisation in\nthe body of the organism. It is therefore not surprising that the uptake\nof food and of oxygen will also be the function of specialised tissues. However, this poses a problem, since the food and oxygen are now taken\nup at one place in the body of the organisms, while all parts of the body\nneed them. This situation creates a need for a transportation system for\ncarrying food and oxygen from one place to another in the body. When chemical reactions use the carbon source and the oxygen for\nenergy generation,  they create by-products that are not only useless\nfor the cells of the body, but could even be harmful.

The form of nutrition\ndiffers depending on the type and availability of food material as well\nas how it is obtained by the organism. For example, whether the food\nsource is stationary (such as grass) or mobile (such as a deer), would\nallow for differences in how the food is accessed and what is the nutritive\napparatus used by a cow and a lion. There is a range of strategies by\nwhich the food is taken in and used by the organism. Some organisms\nbreak-down the food material outside the body and then absorb it. Examples are fungi like bread moulds, yeast and mushrooms. Others\ntake in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can\nbe taken in and broken down depends on the body design and\nfunctioning. Some other organisms derive nutrition from plants or\nanimals without killing them. This parasitic nutritive strategy is used\nby a wide variety of organisms like cuscuta (amar-bel), ticks, lice,\nleeches and tape-worms. 5.2.3 How do Organisms obtain their Nutrition? Since the food and the way it is obtained differ, the digestive system is\ndifferent in various organisms."}

Inside the food-\nvacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones\nwhich then diffuse into the cytoplasm.

This is actually not only water, but a fluid\ncalled saliva secreted by the salivary glands. Another aspect of the food\nwe ingest is its complex nature. If it is to be absorbed from the alimentary\ncanal, it has to be broken into smaller molecules. This is done with the\nhelp of biological catalysts called\nenzymes. The saliva contains an\nenzyme called salivary amylase that\nbreaks down starch which is a complex\nmolecule to give simple sugar. The food\nis mixed thoroughly with saliva and\nmoved around the mouth while\nchewing by the muscular tongue. It is necessary to move the food in\na regulated manner along the digestive\ntube so that it can be processed\nproperly in each part. The lining of\ncanal has muscles that contract\nrhythmically in order to push the food\nforward. These peristaltic movements\noccur all along the gut. From the mouth, the food is taken\nto the stomach through the food-pipe\nor oesophagus. The stomach is a large\norgan which expands when food\nenters it. The muscular walls of the\nstomach help in mixing the food\nthoroughly with more digestive juices. The digestion in stomach is taken\ncare of by the gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach.

From the\nstomach, the food now enters the small intestine. This is the longest part\nof the alimentary canal which is fitted into a compact space because of\nextensive coiling. The length of the small intestine differs in various\nanimals depending on the food they eat. Herbivores eating grass need a\nlonger small intestine to allow the cellulose to be digested.

It receives the secretions of the liver\nand pancreas for this purpose. The food coming from the stomach is\nacidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act. Bile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats. Fats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes\nit difficult for enzymes to act on them.

The other kinds of raw materials needed for\nbuilding plant bodies will also have to be taken up separately. For plants,\nthe soil is the nearest and richest source of raw materials like nitrogen,\nphosphorus and other minerals. The absorption of these substances\ntherefore occurs through the part in contact with the soil, namely roots. If the distances between soil-contacting organs and chlorophyll-\ncontaining organs are small, energy and raw materials can easily diffuse\nto all parts of the plant body. But if these distances become large because\nof changes in plant body design, diffusion processes will not be sufficient\nto provide raw material in leaves and energy in roots. A proper system of\ntransportation is therefore essential in such situations. Energy needs differ between different body designs. Plants do not\nmove, and plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells in many\ntissues. As a result, plants have low energy needs, and can use relatively\nslow transport systems."}

Thus, transpiration helps in the absorption and\nupward movement of water and minerals dissolved\nin it from roots to the leaves. It also helps in\ntemperature regulation. The effect of root pressure in\ntransport of water is more important at night. During\nthe day when the stomata are open, the transpiration\npull becomes the major driving force in the movement\nof water in the xylem. Transport of food and other substances\nSo far we have discussed the transport of water and minerals in plants. Now let us consider how the products of metabolic processes, particularly\nphotosynthesis, are moved from leaves, where they are formed, to other\nparts of the plant. This transport of soluble products of photosynthesis\nis called translocation and it occurs in the part of the vascular tissue\nknown as phloem. Besides the products of photosynthesis, the phloem\ntransports amino acids and other substances. These substances are\nespecially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and\nto growing organs. The translocation of food and other substances takes\nplace in the sieve tubes with the help of adjacent companion cells both\nin upward and downward directions."}

Kidneys are located in the\nabdomen, one on either side of the backbone. Urine\nproduced in the kidneys passes through the ureters\ninto the urinary bladder where it is stored until it is\nreleased through the urethra. How is urine produced? The purpose of making\nurine is to filter out waste products from the blood. Just as CO2 is removed from the blood in the lungs,\nnitrogenous waste such as urea or uric acid are\nremoved from blood in the kidneys. It is then no\nsurprise that the basic filtration unit in the kidneys,\nFigure 5.13\nExcretory system in human beings\nReprint 2025-26\nLife Processes\n97\nlike in the lungs, is a cluster of very thin-walled blood\ncapillaries. Each capillary cluster in the kidney is\nassociated with the cup-shaped end of a coiled tube\ncalled Bowman\u2019s capsule that collects the filtrate\n (Fig. 5.14). Each kidney has large numbers of these\nfiltration units called nephrons packed close together. Some substances in the initial filtrate, such as glucose,\namino acids, salts and a major amount of water, are\nselectively re-absorbed as the urine flows along the tube. The amount of water re-absorbed depends on how much\nexcess water there is in the body, and on how much of\ndissolved waste there is to be excreted. The urine forming\nin each kidney eventually enters a long tube, the ureter,\nwhich connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder. Urine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure\nof the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out\nthrough the urethra."}

Several factors like infections, injury or restricted\nblood flow to kidneys reduce the activity of kidneys. This leads to accumulation of\npoisonous wastes in the body, which can even lead to death. In case of kidney\nfailure, an artificial kidney can be used. An artificial kidney is a device to remove\nnitrogenous waste products from the blood through dialysis. Artificial kidneys contain a number of tubes with a semi-permeable lining, suspended\nin a tank filled with dialysing fluid. This fluid has the same osmotic\npressure as blood, except that it is\ndevoid of nitrogenous wastes. The\npatient\u2019s blood is passed through\nthese tubes. During this passage,\nthe waste products from the blood\npass into dialysing fluid by diffusion. The purified blood is pumped back\ninto the patient. This is similar to the\nfunction of the kidney, but it is\ndifferent since there is no re-\nabsorption involved. Normally, in a\nhealthy adult, the initial filtrate in the\nkidneys is about 180 L daily. However, the volume actually\nexcreted is only a litre or two a day,\nbecause the remaining filtrate is re-\nabsorbed in the kidney tubules.

Some\nmovements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected\nwith growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes\nchewing cud \u2013 these are not movements caused by growth. Why do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has\nseen a mouse. Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt\nby living organisms to use changes in their environment to their\nadvantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure\nand fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough\nfood so as to be able to digest it better. When bright light is focussed on\nour eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond\nto it with movement in order to protect ourselves. If we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this\nmovement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each\nkind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement\nin response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper,\nrather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends\non the event that is triggering it.

This information, acquired at the\nend of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell\n[Fig. 6.1 (a)], sets off a chemical reaction\nthat creates an electrical impulse. This\nimpulse travels from the dendrite to the\ncell body, and then along the axon to its\nend. At the end of the axon, the electrical\nimpulse sets off the release of some\nchemicals. These chemicals cross the\ngap, or synapse, and start a similar\nelectrical impulse in a dendrite of the next\nneuron. This is a general scheme of how\nnervous impulses travel in the body. A\nsimilar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to\nother cells, such as muscles cells or gland  [Fig. 6.1 (b)].

An important question then is, how long\nwill it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think. If\nnerve impulses are sent around the way we have talked about earlier,\nthen thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses. Thinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated\ninteraction of many nerve impulses from many neurons.

The best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet\neach other. Nerves from all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal\ncord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord\nitself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain. Of course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking\nprocess of the brain is not fast enough.

So, the brain also has to\nsend messages to muscles. This is the second way in which the nervous\nsystem communicates with the muscles. The communication between\nthe central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated\nby the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising\nfrom the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain\nthus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking. As you\nwill expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different\nparts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs. The brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain,\nmid-brain and hind-brain. The fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions\nwhich receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas\nof the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on.

The plants also use electrical-chemical\nmeans to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals,\nthere is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information. Finally, again as in animals, some cells must change shape in order for\nmovement to happen. Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal\nmuscle cells, plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water\nin them, resulting in swelling or shrinking, and therefore in changing\nshapes (Fig. 6.4). 6.2.2 Movement Due to Growth\nSome plants like the pea plant climb up other plants or fences by means\nof tendrils. These tendrils are sensitive to touch. When they come in\ncontact with any support, the part of the tendril in contact with the object\ndoes not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object. This causes the tendril to circle around the object and thus cling to it. More commonly, plants respond to stimuli slowly by growing in a\nparticular direction.

This upward and downward growth\nof shoots and roots, respectively, in response to the pull of earth or gravity\nis, obviously, geotropism (Fig. 6.6). If \u2018hydro\u2019 means water and \u2018chemo\u2019\nrefers to chemicals, what would \u2018hydrotropism\u2019 and \u2018chemotropism\u2019\nmean? Can we think of examples of these kinds of directional growth\nmovements? One example of chemotropism is the growth of pollen tubes\ntowards ovules, about which we will learn more when we examine the\nreproductive processes of living organisms. Let us now once again think about how information is communicated\nin the bodies of multicellular organisms. The movement of the\nsensitive plant in response to touch is very quick. The movement of\nsunflowers in response to day or night, on the other hand, is quite slow. Growth-related movement of plants will be even slower. Even in animal bodies, there are carefully controlled directions to\ngrowth. Our arms and fingers grow in certain directions, not haphazardly. So controlled movements can be either slow or fast. If fast responses to\nstimuli are to be made, information transfer must happen very quickly. For this, the medium of transmission must be able to move rapidly.

But there are\nlimitations to the use of electrical impulses. Firstly, they will reach only\nthose cells that are connected by nervous tissue, not each and every cell\nin the animal body. Secondly, once an electrical impulse is generated in\na cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms\nbefore it can generate and transmit a new impulse. In other words, cells\ncannot continually create and transmit electrical impulses. It is thus no\nwonder that most multicellular organisms use another means of\ncommunication between cells, namely, chemical communication. If, instead of generating an electrical impulse, stimulated cells release\na chemical compound, this compound would diffuse all around the\noriginal cell. If other cells around have the means to detect this compound\nusing special molecules on their surfaces, then they would be able to\nrecognise information, and even transmit it."}

Different plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and\nresponses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from\nwhere they act and simply diffuse to the area of action. Let us take an example that we have worked with earlier [Activity 6.2]. When growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised\nat the shoot tip, helps the cells to grow longer. When light is coming from\none side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot. This concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the\nside of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to\nbend towards light. Another example of plant hormones are gibberellins which, like\nauxins, help in the growth of the stem. Cytokinins promote cell division,\nand it is natural then that they are present in greater concentration in\nareas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds.

Both are very complicated\nactivities that will use a great deal of energy in controlled ways. Many\ndifferent tissue types will be used and their activities integrated together\nin these actions. However, the two alternate activities, fighting or running,\nare also quite different! So here is a situation in which some common\npreparations can be usefully made in the body. These preparations\nshould ideally make it easier to do either activity in the near future. How\nwould this be achieved? If the body design in the squirrel relied only on electrical impulses\nvia nerve cells, the range of tissues instructed to prepare for the coming\nactivity would be limited. On the other hand, if a chemical signal were to\nbe sent as well, it would reach all cells of the body and provide the wide-\nranging changes needed. This is done in many animals, including human\nbeings, using a hormone called adrenaline that is secreted from the\nadrenal glands. Look at Fig. 6.7 to locate these glands. Adrenaline is secreted directly into the blood and carried to different\nparts of the body. The target organs or the specific tissues on which it\nacts include the heart.

The DNA in the cell nucleus is the information\nsource for making proteins. If the information is changed, different\nproteins will be made. Different proteins will eventually lead to altered\nbody designs. Therefore, a basic event in reproduction is the creation of a DNA\ncopy. Cells use chemical reactions to build copies of their DNA. This\ncreates two copies of the DNA in a reproducing cell, and they will need to\nbe separated from each other. However, keeping one copy of DNA in the\noriginal cell and simply pushing the other one out would not work,\nReprint 2025-26\nScience\n114\n? because the copy pushed out would not have any organised cellular\nstructure for maintaining life processes. Therefore, DNA copying is\naccompanied by the creation of an additional cellular apparatus, and\nthen the DNA copies separate, each with its own cellular apparatus. Effectively, a cell divides to give rise to two cells. These two cells are of course similar, but are they likely to be\nabsolutely identical? The answer to this question will depend on how\naccurately the copying reactions involved occur. No bio-chemical reaction\nis absolutely reliable. Therefore, it is only to be expected that the process\nof copying the DNA will have some variations each time. As a result, the\nDNA copies generated will be similar, but may not be identical to the\noriginal.

The consistency of DNA\ncopying during reproduction is important for the maintenance of body\ndesign features that allow the organism to use that particular niche. Reproduction is therefore linked to the stability of populations of species. However, niches can change because of reasons beyond the control\nof the organisms. Temperatures on earth can go up or down, water levels\ncan vary, or there could be meteorite hits, to think of a few examples. If\na population of reproducing organisms were suited to a particular niche\nand if the niche were drastically altered, the population could be wiped\nout. However, if some variations were to be present in a few individuals\nin these populations, there would be some chance for them to survive. Thus, if there were a population of bacteria living in temperate waters,\nand if the water temperature were to be increased by global warming,\nmost of these bacteria would die, but the few variants resistant to heat\nwould survive and grow further.

In such a\ncarefully organised situation, cell-by-cell division would be impractical. Multi-cellular organisms, therefore, need to use more complex ways of\nreproduction. A basic strategy used in multi-cellular organisms is that different\ncell types perform different specialised functions. Following this general\npattern, reproduction in such organisms is also the function of a specific\ncell type. How is reproduction to be achieved from a single cell type, if\nthe organism itself consists of many cell types?

This is known as\nasexual reproduction. Q\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n? 1. How does binary fission differ from multiple fission? 2. How will an organism be benefited if it reproduces through spores? 3. Can you think of reasons why more complex organisms cannot give\nrise to new individuals through regeneration? 4. Why is vegetative propagation practised for growing some types of\nplants? 5. Why is DNA copying an essential part of the process of reproduction? 7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\n7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\n7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\n7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\n7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\nWe are also familiar with modes of reproduction that depend on the\ninvolvement of two individuals before a new generation can be created. Bulls alone cannot produce new calves, nor can hens alone produce\nnew chicks. In such cases, both sexes, males and females, are needed to\nproduce new generations. What is the significance of this sexual mode\nof reproduction? Are there any limitations of the asexual mode of\nreproduction, which we have been discussing above? 7.3.1 Why the Sexual Mode of Reproduction? The creation of two new cells from one involves copying of the DNA as\nwell as of the cellular apparatus."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 156, "content": "The DNA copying mechanism, as we\nhave noted, cannot be absolutely accurate, and the resultant errors are\na source of variations in populations of organisms. Every individual\norganism cannot be protected by variations, but in a population,\nvariations are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. It would\ntherefore make sense if organisms came up with reproductive modes\nthat allowed more and more variation to be generated. While DNA-copying mechanisms are not absolutely accurate, they\nare precise enough to make the generation of variation a fairly slow\nprocess. If the DNA copying mechanisms were to be less accurate, many\nof the resultant DNA copies would not be able to work with the cellular\napparatus, and would die. So how can the process of making variants\nbe speeded up? Each new variation is made in a DNA copy that already\nhas variations accumulated from previous generations. Thus, two\ndifferent individuals in a population would have quite different patterns\nof accumulated variations. Since all of these variations are in living\nindividuals, it is assured that they do not have any really bad effects. Combining variations from two or more individuals would thus create\nnew combinations of variants. Each combination would be novel, since\nit would involve two different individuals. The sexual mode of\nReprint 2025-26\nScience\n120\nreproduction incorporates such a process of combining DNA from two\ndifferent individuals during reproduction. But this creates a major difficulty. If each new generation is to be the\ncombination of the DNA copies from two pre-existing individuals, then\neach new generation will end up having twice the amount of DNA that\nthe previous generation had. This is likely to mess up the control of the\ncellular apparatus by the DNA. How many ways can we think of for\nsolving this difficulty?"}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 157, "content": "We have seen earlier that as organisms become more complex, the\nspecialisation of tissue increases. One solution that many multi-cellular\norganisms have found for the problem mentioned above is to have special\nlineages of cells in specialised organs in which only half the number of\nchromosomes and half the amount of DNA as compared to the non-\nreproductive body cells. This is achieved by a process of cell division\ncalled meiosis. Thus, when these germ-cells from two individuals combine\nduring sexual reproduction to form a new individual, it results in re-\nestablishment of the number of chromosomes and the DNA content in\nthe new generation. If the zygote is to grow and develop into an organism which has\nhighly specialised tissues and organs, then it has to have sufficient stores\nof energy for doing this. In very simple organisms, it is seen that the two\ngerm-cells are not very different from one another, or may even be similar. But as the body designs become more complex, the germ-cells also\nspecialise. One germ-cell is large and contains the food-stores while the\nother is smaller and likely to be motile. Conventionally, the motile germ-\ncell is called the male gamete and the germ-cell containing the stored\nfood is called the female gamete. We shall see in the next few sections\nhow the need to create these two different types of gametes give rise to\ndifferences in the male and female reproductive organs and, in some\ncases, differences in the bodies of the male and female organisms. 7.3.2 Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants\nThe reproductive parts of angiosperms are located in the flower. You\nhave already studied the different parts of a flower \u2013 sepals, petals,\nstamens and pistil. Stamens and pistil are\nthe reproductive parts of a flower which\ncontain the germ-cells."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 158, "content": "What possible\nfunctions could the petals and sepals serve? The flower may be unisexual (papaya,\nwatermelon) when it contains either stamens\nor pistil or bisexual (Hibiscus, mustard)\nwhen it contains both stamens and pistil. Stamen is the male reproductive part and it\nproduces pollen grains that are yellowish\nin colour. You must have seen this yellowish\npowder that often sticks to our hands if we\ntouch the stamen of a flower. Pistil is present\nin the centre of a flower and is the female\nreproductive part. It is made of three parts.

The ovary\ncontains ovules and each ovule has an egg cell. The male germ-cell\nproduced by pollen grain fuses with the female gamete present in\nthe ovule. This fusion of the germ-cells or fertilisation gives us the\nzygote which is capable of growing into a new plant. Thus the pollen needs to be transferred from the stamen to the\nstigma. If this transfer of pollen occurs in the same flower, it is\nreferred to as self-pollination. On the other hand, if the pollen is\ntransferred from one flower to another, it is known as cross-\npollination. This transfer of pollen from one flower to another is\nachieved by agents like wind, water or animals. After the pollen lands on a suitable stigma, it has to reach the\nfemale germ-cells which are in the ovary."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 159, "content": "For this, a tube grows\nout of the pollen grain and travels through the style to reach the\novary. After fertilisation, the zygote divides several times to form an\nembryo within the ovule. The ovule develops a tough coat and is\ngradually converted into a seed. The ovary grows rapidly and ripens\nto form a fruit. Meanwhile, the petals, sepals, stamens, style and\nstigma may shrivel and fall off. Have you ever observed any flower\npart still persisting in the fruit? Try and work out the advantages\nof seed-formation for the plant.

Let us now look at the species that we are most\ninterested in, namely, humans. Humans use a sexual mode of\nreproduction. How does this process work? Let us begin at an apparently unrelated point. All of us know that\nour bodies change as we become older. You have learnt changes that\ntake place in your body earlier in Class VIII also. We notice that our\nheight has increased continuously from early age till now."}

Figure 7.9\nFigure 7.9\nFigure 7.9\nFigure 7.9\nFigure 7.9\nGermination\nReprint 2025-26\nScience\n122\nAll of these are changes that can be grouped under the general process\nof growth, in which the body becomes larger. But in early teenage years,\na whole new set of changes occurs that cannot be explained simply as\nbody enlargement. Instead, the appearance of the body changes. Proportions change, new features appear, and so do new sensations. Some of these changes are common to both boys and girls. We begin\nto notice thick hair growing in new parts of the body such as armpits\nand the genital area between the thighs, which can also become darker\nin colour. Thinner hair can also appear on legs and arms, as well as on\nthe face. The skin frequently becomes oily and we might begin to develop\npimples. We begin to be conscious and aware of both our own bodies\nand those of others in new ways. On the other hand, there are also changes taking place that are\ndifferent between boys and girls. In girls, breast size begins to increase,\nwith darkening of the skin of the nipples at the tips of the breasts. Also,\ngirls begin to menstruate at around this time. Boys begin to have new\nthick hair growth on the face and their voices begin to crack. Further,\nthe penis occasionally begins to become enlarged and erect, either in\ndaydreams or at night. All of these changes take place slowly, over a period of months and\nyears. They do not happen all at the same time in one person, nor do\nthey happen at an exact age."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 161, "content": "In some people, they happen early and\nquickly, while in others, they can happen slowly. Also, each change does\nnot become complete quickly either. So, for example, thick hair on the\nface in boys appears as a few scattered hairs first, and only slowly does\nthe growth begin to become uniform. Even so, all these changes show\ndifferences between people. Just as we have differently shaped noses or\nfingers, so also we have different patterns of hair growth, or size and\nshape of breast or penis. All of these changes are aspects of the sexual\nmaturation of the body. Why does the body show sexual maturation at this age? We have\ntalked about the need for specialised cell types in multi-cellular bodies\nto carry out specialised functions. The creation of germ-cells to participate\nin sexual reproduction is another specialised function, and we have seen\nthat plants develop special cell and tissue types to create them. Human\nbeings also develop special tissues for this purpose. However, while the\nbody of the individual organism is growing to its adult size, the resources\nof the body are mainly directed at achieving this growth. While that is\nhappening, the maturation of the reproductive tissue is not likely to be\na major priority. Thus, as the rate of general body growth begins to slow\ndown, reproductive tissues begin to mature. This period during\nadolescence is called puberty. So how do all the changes that we have talked about link to the\nreproductive process? We must remember that the sexual mode of\nreproduction means that germ-cells from two individuals have to join\ntogether. This can happen by the external release of germ-cells from the\nbodies of individuals, as happens in flowering plants."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 162, "content": "Or it can happen\nby two individuals joining their bodies together for internal transfer of\ngerm-cells for fusion, as happens in many animals. If animals are to\nReprint 2025-26\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 123\nparticipate in this process of mating, their state of sexual maturity must\nbe identifiable by other individuals. Many changes during puberty, such\nas new hair-growth patterns, are signals that sexual maturation is taking\nplace. On the other hand, the actual transfer of germ-cells between two\npeople needs special organs for the sexual act, such as the penis when it\nis capable of becoming erect. In mammals such as humans, the baby is\ncarried in the mother\u2019s body for a long period, and will be breast-fed\nlater. The female reproductive organs and breasts will need to mature to\naccommodate these possibilities. Let us look at the systems involved in\nthe process of sexual reproduction. 7.3.3 (a) Male Reproductive System\nThe male reproductive system (Fig. 7.10)\nconsists of portions which produce the\ngerm-cells and other portions that deliver\nthe germ-cells to the site of fertilisation. The formation of germ-cells or sperms\ntakes place in the testes. These are located\noutside the abdominal cavity in scrotum\nbecause sperm formation requires a lower\ntemperature than the normal body\ntemperature. We have discussed the role of the\ntestes in the secretion of the hormone,\ntestosterone, in the previous chapter. In\naddition to regulating the formation of sperms,\ntestosterone brings about changes in\nappearance seen in boys at the time of puberty. The sperms formed are delivered\nthrough the vas deferens which unites with\na tube coming from the urinary bladder. The\nurethra thus forms a common passage for\nboth the sperms and urine."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 163, "content": "Along the path\nof the vas deferens, glands like the prostate\nand the seminal vesicles add their secretions\nso that the sperms are now in a fluid which\nmakes their transport easier and this fluid\nalso provides nutrition. The sperms are tiny\nbodies that consist of mainly genetic\nmaterial and a long tail that helps them to\nmove towards the female germ-cell. 7.3.3 (b) Female Reproductive System\nThe female germ-cells or eggs are made in\nthe ovaries. They are also responsible for the\nproduction of some hormones. Look at\nFig. 7.11 and identify the various organs in\nthe female reproductive system. Figure 7.10 \nFigure 7.10 \nFigure 7.10 \nFigure 7.10 \nFigure 7.10 Human\u2013male reproductive system\nFigure 7.11 \nFigure 7.11 \nFigure 7.11 \nFigure 7.11 \nFigure 7.11 Human \u2013female reproductive system\nReprint 2025-26\nScience\n124\nWhen a girl is born, the ovaries already contain thousands of\nimmature eggs. On reaching puberty, some of these start maturing. One\negg is produced every month by one of the ovaries. The egg is carried\nfrom the ovary to the womb through a thin oviduct or fallopian tube. The two oviducts unite into an elastic bag-like structure known as the\nuterus. The uterus opens into the vagina through the cervix. The sperms enter through the vaginal passage during sexual\nintercourse. They travel upwards and reach the oviduct where they may\nencounter the egg. The fertilised egg (zygote) starts dividing and form a\nball of cells or embryo. The embryo is implanted in the lining of the uterus\nwhere they continue to grow and develop organs to become foetus. We\nhave seen in earlier sections that the mother\u2019s body is designed to\nundertake the development of the child. Hence the uterus prepares itself\nevery month to receive and nurture the growing embryo."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 164, "content": "The lining\nthickens and is richly supplied with blood to nourish the growing embryo. The embryo gets nutrition from the mother\u2019s blood with the help of a\nspecial tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the\nuterine wall. It contains villi on the embryo\u2019s side of the tissue. On the\nmother\u2019s side are blood spaces, which surround the villi. This provides\na large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to\nthe embryo. The developing embryo will also generate waste substances\nwhich can be removed by transferring them into the mother\u2019s blood\nthrough the placenta. The development of the child inside the mother\u2019s\nbody takes approximately nine months. The child is born as a result of\nrhythmic contractions of the muscles in the uterus. 7.3.3 (c) What happens when the Egg is not Fertilised? If the egg is not fertilised, it lives for about one day. Since the ovary\nreleases one egg every month, the uterus also prepares itself every month\nto receive a fertilised egg. Thus its lining becomes thick and spongy. This would be required for nourishing the embryo if fertilisation had\ntaken place. Now, however, this lining is not needed any longer. So, the\nlining slowly breaks and comes out through the vagina as blood and\nmucous. This cycle takes place roughly every month and is known as\nmenstruation. It usually lasts for about two to eight days. 7.3.3 (d) Reproductive Health\nAs we have seen, the process of sexual maturation is gradual, and takes\nplace while general body growth is still going on. Therefore, some degree\nof sexual maturation does not necessarily mean that the body or the\nmind is ready for sexual acts or for having and bringing up children."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 165, "content": "How do we decide if the body or the mind is ready for this major\nresponsibility? All of us are under many different kinds of pressures\nabout these issues. There can be pressure from our friends for\nparticipating in many activities, whether we really want to or not. There\ncan be pressure from families to get married and start having children. There can be pressure from government agencies to avoid having\nchildren. In this situation, making choices can become very difficult. Reprint 2025-26\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 125\nWe must also consider the possible health consequences of having\nsex. We have discussed in Class IX that diseases can be transmitted\nfrom person to person in a variety of ways. Since the sexual act is a\nvery intimate connection of bodies, it is not surprising that many\ndiseases can be sexually transmitted. These include bacterial infections\nsuch as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as warts\nand HIV-AIDS. Is it possible to prevent the transmission of such diseases\nduring the sexual act? Using a covering, called a condom, for the penis\nduring sex helps to prevent transmission of many of these infections to\nsome extent. The sexual act always has the potential to lead to pregnancy. Pregnancy will make major demands on the body and the mind of the\nwoman, and if she is not ready for it, her health will be adversely\naffected. Therefore, many ways have been devised to avoid pregnancy. These contraceptive methods fall in a number of categories. One\ncategory is the creation of a mechanical barrier so that sperm does not\nreach the egg. Condoms on the penis or similar coverings worn in the\nvagina can serve this purpose."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 166, "content": "Another category of contraceptives acts\nby changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not\nreleased and fertilisation cannot occur. These drugs commonly need\nto be taken orally as pills. However, since they change hormonal\nbalances, they can cause side-effects too. Other contraceptive devices\nsuch as the loop or the copper-T are placed in the uterus to prevent\npregnancy. Again, they can cause side effects due to irritation of the\nuterus. If the vas deferens in the male is blocked, sperm transfer will\nbe prevented. If the fallopian tube in the female is blocked, the egg will\nnot be able to reach the uterus. In both cases fertilisation will not take\nplace. Surgical methods can be used to create such blocks. While\nsurgical methods are safe in the long run, surgery itself can cause\ninfections and other problems if not performed properly. Surgery can\nalso be used for removal of unwanted pregnancies. These may be\nmisused by people who do not want a particular child, as happens in\nillegal sex-selective abortion of female foetuses. For a healthy society,\nthe female-male sex ratio must be maintained. Because of reckless\nfemale foeticides, child sex ratio is declining at an alarming rate in\nsome sections of our society, although prenatal sex determination has\nbeen prohibited by law. We have noted earlier that reproduction is the process by which\norganisms increase their populations. The rates of birth and death in a\ngiven population will determine its size. The size of the human population\nis a cause for concern for many people. This is because an expanding\npopulation makes it harder to improve everybody\u2019s standard of living. However, if inequality in society is the main reason for poor standards of\nliving for many people, the size of the population is relatively unimportant."}

So the next\nquestion was, were the tall plants in the F1\ngeneration exactly the same as the tall plants of the\nparent generation? Mendelian experiments test this\nby getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall\nplants to reproduce by self-pollination. The progeny\nof the parental plants are, of course, all tall. However,\nthe second-generation, or F2, progeny of the F1 tall\nplants are not all tall. Instead, one quarter of them\nare short. This indicates that both the tallness and\nshortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants, but\nonly the tallness trait was expressed. This led Mendel\nto propose that two copies of factor (now called genes)\ncontrolling traits are present in sexually reproducing\norganism. These two may be identical, or may be\ndifferent, depending on the parentage. A pattern of\ninheritance can be worked out with this assumption,\nas shown in Fig. 8.3.

You can see as to how new combinations of\ntraits are formed in F2 offspring when factors controlling for seed\nshape and seed colour recombine to form zygote leading to form\nF2 offspring (Fig. 8.5). Thus, the tall/short trait and the round\nseed/wrinkled seed trait are independently inherited. 8.2.3 How do these Traits get Expressed? How does the mechanism of heredity work? Cellular DNA is\nthe information source for making proteins in the cell. A section\nof DNA that provides information for one protein is called the\ngene for that protein. How do proteins control the\ncharacteristics that we are discussing here? Let us take the\nexample of tallness as a characteristic. We know that plants\nhave hormones that can trigger growth. Plant height can thus\ndepend on the amount of a particular plant hormone. The\namount of the plant hormone made will depend on the\nefficiency of the process for making it. Consider now an enzyme\nthat is important for this process. If this enzyme works\nefficiently, a lot of hormone will be made, and the plant will be\ntall. If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration that makes\nthe enzyme less efficient, the amount of hormone will be less,\nand the plant will be short. Thus, genes control characteristics,\nor traits. If the interpretations of Mendelian experiments we have been\ndiscussing are correct, then both parents must be contributing\nequally to the DNA of the progeny during sexual reproduction. We have disscussed this issue in the previous Chapter. If both\nparents can help determine the trait in the progeny, both parents\nmust be contributing a copy of the same gene."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 175, "content": "This means that\neach pea plant must have two sets of all genes, one inherited from\neach parent. For this mechanism to work, each germ cell must\nhave only one gene set. How do germ-cells make a single set of genes from the normal two\ncopies that all other cells in the body have? If progeny plants inherited a\nsingle whole gene set from each parent, then the experiment explained\nin Fig. 8.5 cannot work. This is because the two characteristics \u2018R\u2019 and\n\u2018y\u2019 would then be linked to each other and cannot be independently\nFigure 8.4\nFigure 8.4\nFigure 8.4\nFigure 8.4\nFigure 8.4\nReprint 2025-26\nScience\n132\ninherited. This is explained by the fact that each gene set is present, not\nas a single long thread of DNA, but as separate independent pieces,\neach called a chromosome. Thus, each cell will have two copies of each\nchromosome, one each from the male and female parents. Every germ-\ncell will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either\nmaternal or paternal origin. When two germ cells combine, they will\nrestore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring\nthe stability of the DNA of the species. Such a mechanism of inheritance\nexplains the results of the Mendel experiments, and is used by all\nsexually reproducing organisms. But asexually reproducing organisms\nalso follow similar rules of inheritance.

{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 176, "content": "Thus,\nin some animals like a few reptiles, the temperature at\nwhich fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the\nanimals developing in the eggs will be male or female. In\nother animals, such as snails, individuals can change sex,\nindicating that sex is not genetically determined. However,\nin human beings, the sex of the individual is largely\ngenetically determined. In other words, the genes inherited\nfrom our parents decide whether we will be boys or girls. But so far, we have assumed that similar gene sets are\ninherited from both parents. If that is the case, how can\ngenetic inheritance determine sex? The explanation lies in the fact that all human\nchromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes\nhave a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22\nsuch pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is\nodd in not always being a perfect pair. Women have a\nperfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men\nhave a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X\nwhile the other is a short one called Y. So women are XX,\nwhile men are XY. Now, can we work out what the\ninheritance pattern of X and Y will be? As Fig. 8.6 shows, half the children will be boys and\nhalf will be girls. All children will inherit an X chromosome\nfrom their mother regardless of whether they are boys or\ngirls. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by\nwhat they inherit from their father.

On lighting up the room,\nthings become visible. What makes things visible? During the day, the\nsunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it. This reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things. We are able to see through a transparent medium as light is transmitted\nthrough it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomena\nassociated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling\nof stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium\nand so on. A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them. By observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may\nconclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a small\nsource of light casts a sharp shadow of an opaque object points to this\nstraight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light. More to Know! If an opaque object on the path of light becomes very small, light has a tendency to\nbend around it and not walk in a straight line \u2013 an effect known as the diffraction of\nlight."}

The light here\nhas bent away from the normal. Compare the\nangle of incidence with the angle of refraction\nat both refracting surfaces AB and CD. In Fig. 9.10, a ray EO is obliquely\nincident on surface AB, called incident ray. OO\u2032 is the refracted ray and O\u2032 H is the\nemergent ray. You may observe that the\nemergent ray is parallel to the direction of\nthe incident ray. Why does it happen so? The\nextent of bending of the ray of light at the\nopposite parallel faces AB (air-glass interface)\nand CD (glass-air interface) of the rectangular\nglass slab is equal and opposite.

The extent of the change in direction that takes place\nin a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,\nthe \u201cconstant\u201d appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4). The refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,\nthe relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns\nout that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light\ntravels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3\u00d7108 m s\u20131. In air, the speed of\nlight is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces\nconsiderably in glass or water. The value of the refractive index for a\ngiven pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as\ngiven below. Consider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as\nshown in Fig.9.11. Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the\nspeed of light in medium 2. The refractive index of medium 2 with respect\nto medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and\nthe speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol\nn21.

Optical density has a definite connotation. It is not the same as mass density. We have\nbeen using the terms \u2018rarer medium\u2019 and \u2018denser medium\u2019 in this Chapter. It actually\nmeans  \u2018optically rarer medium\u2019 and \u2018optically denser medium\u2019, respectively. When can\nwe say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the\none with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other. The other\nmedium of lower refractive index is optically rarer. The speed of light is higher in a rarer\nmedium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a\ndenser medium slows down and bends  towards the normal. When it travels from a\ndenser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal. Note from Table 9.3 that an optically denser medium may not possess\ngreater mass density. For example, kerosene having higher refractive\nindex, is optically denser than water, although its mass density is less\nthan water."}

Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This point\non the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us see\nnow the action of a concave lens. Observe Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal\naxis. This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the\nconcave lens. If you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens, you\nget another principal focus on the opposite side. Letter F is usually used\nto represent principal focus. However, a lens has two principal foci. They\nare represented by F1 and F2. The distance of the principal focus from\nthe optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. The letter f  is used to\nrepresent the focal length. How can you find the focal length of a convex\nlens? Recall the Activity 9.11."}

{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 211, "content": "For example, a convex lens of\nshort focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussing\nthem closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very short\nfocal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal\nlength. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved\nby a lens is expressed in terms of its power. The power of a lens is defined\nas the reciprocal of its focal length. It is represented by the letter P.  The\npower P of a lens of focal length f is given by\nP = \n1\nf\n(9.11)\nReprint 2025-26\nScience\n158\nThe SI unit of power of a lens is \u2018dioptre\u2019.

You may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of a\nconcave lens is negative. Opticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers. Let us\nsay the lens prescribed has power equal to + 2.0 D.  This means the lens\nprescribed is convex. The focal length of the lens is + 0.50 m. Similarly,\na lens of power \u2013 2.5 D has a focal length of \u2013 0.40 m.  The lens is concave. Many optical instruments consist of a number of lenses. They are combined to increase\nthe magnification and sharpness of the image. The net power (P ) of the lenses placed\nin contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers P1, P2, P3, \u2026   as\nP = P1 + P2 + P3 + \u2026\nThe use of powers, instead of focal lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for opticians."}

It enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On\nclosing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell,\ntaste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however, impossible to identify\ncolours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human\neye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful,\ncolourful world around us. The human eye is like a camera. Its lens\nsystem forms an image on a light-sensitive\nscreen called the retina. Light enters the eye\nthrough a thin membrane called the cornea. It forms the transparent bulge on the front\nsurface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1. The eyeball is approximately spherical in shape\nwith a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the\nrefraction for the light rays entering the eye\noccurs at the outer surface of the cornea."}

The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the object\non the retina. The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous\nnumber of light-sensitive cells. The light-sensitive cells get activated\nupon illumination and generate electrical signals. These signals are\nsent to the brain via the optic nerves. The brain interprets these signals,\nand finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as\nthey are. 10.1.1 Power of Accommodation\nThe eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature\ncan be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the\ncurvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the\nmuscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length\nincreases. This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are\nlooking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This\nincreases the curvature of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker. Consequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases. This enables\nus to see nearby objects clearly. The ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called\naccommodation. However, the focal length of the eye lens cannot be\ndecreased below a certain minimum limit. Try to read a printed page by\nholding it very close to your eyes."}

The minimum distance, at\nwhich objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called the\nleast distance of distinct vision. It is also called the near point of the eye. For a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about\n25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is\ncalled the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a normal eye. You may note\nhere a normal eye can see objects clearly that are between 25 cm and\ninfinity.

In a myopic\neye, the image of a distant object is\nformed in front of the retina [Fig. 10.2 (b)] and not at the retina itself. This defect may arise due to (i)\nexcessive curvature of the eye lens,\nor (ii) elongation of the eyeball. This\ndefect can be corrected by using a\nconcave lens of suitable power. This\nis illustrated in Fig. 10.2 (c). A\nconcave lens of suitable power will\nbring the image back on to the\nretina and thus the defect is corrected. (b)\nHypermetropia\nHypermetropia is also known as far-sightedness. A person with hypermetropia can see distant\nobjects clearly but cannot see nearby objects\ndistinctly. The near point, for the person, is farther\naway from the normal near point (25 cm). Such a\nperson has to keep a reading material much\nbeyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable\nreading.

Yet something makes each colour distinct from the other. The splitting\nof light into its component colours is called dispersion. You have seen that white light is dispersed\ninto its seven-colour components by a prism. Why do we get these colours? Different colours\nof light bend through different angles with\nrespect to the incident ray, as they pass\nthrough a prism. The red light bends the least\nwhile the violet the most. Thus the rays of each\ncolour emerge along different paths and thus\nbecome distinct. It is the band of distinct\ncolours that we see in a spectrum. Isaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain\nthe spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of\nthe spectrum of white light further by using another similar\nprism. However, he could not get any more colours. He\nthen placed a second identical prism in an inverted position\nwith respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This\nallowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through\nthe second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging\nfrom the other side of the second prism.

The air just above the fire becomes\nhotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense)\nthan the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly\nless than that of the cooler air. Since the physical conditions of\nthe refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent\nposition of the object, as seen through the hot air, fluctuates. This wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction\nof light by the earth\u2019s atmosphere) on a small scale in our local\nenvironment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on\na much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 227, "content": "Twinkling of stars\nThe twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The\nstarlight, on entering the earth\u2019s atmosphere, undergoes refraction\ncontinuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction\noccurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the\natmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position\nof the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears\nslightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the\nhorizon (Fig. 10.9). Further, this apparent position of the star is not\nstationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions\nof the earth\u2019s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the\nprevious paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate\npoint-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from\nthe star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star\nfluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers \u2013 the\nstar sometimes appears brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which\nis the twinkling effect. Why don\u2019t the planets twinkle? The planets are much\ncloser to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources. If we consider a planet as a collection of a large number\nof point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the\namount of light entering our eye from all the individual\npoint-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby\nnullifying the twinkling effect.

The blue colour of the sky, colour of\nwater in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset\nare some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous\nclass, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles. The path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible. However, its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where the\nsize of the particles is relatively larger. 10.6.1 Tyndall Effect\nThe earth\u2019s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles. These particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles\nof dust and molecules of air. When a beam of light strikes such fine\nparticles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us,\nafter being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of\nscattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect\nwhich you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a\nfine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole. Thus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can\nalso be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense\nforest. Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 229, "content": "The colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering\nparticles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of\nlarger size scatter light of longer wavelengths. If the size of the scattering\nparticles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear\nwhite. 10.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue? The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size\nsmaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in\nscattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer\nwavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8\ntimes greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the\natmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter\nwavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters\nour eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been\nany scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark. The sky appears\ndark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not\nprominent at such heights. You might have observed that \u2018danger\u2019 signal lights are red in colour.

Similarly we replace\nthe parallel resistors R3, R4 and R5 by an equivalent single\nresistor of resistance R\u2033. Then using Eq.

Thus, the total resistance, R = R\u2032 + R\u2033 = 18 \u2126. To calculate the current, we use Ohm\u2019s law, and get\n I = V/R = 12 V/18 \u2126 = 0.67 A. We have seen that in a series circuit the current is constant\nthroughout the electric circuit. Thus it is obviously impracticable to\nconnect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they\nneed currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example\n11.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one\ncomponent fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works.

The direction of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which a\nnorth pole of the compass needle moves inside it. Therefore it is taken\nby convention that the field lines emerge from north pole and merge at\nthe south pole (note the arrows marked on the field lines in Fig. 12.4). Inside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its\nnorth pole. Thus the magnetic field lines are closed curves. The relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of\ncloseness of the field lines. The field is stronger, that is, the force acting\non the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are\ncrowded (see Fig. 12.4)."}

This series or organisms taking part at\nvarious biotic levels form a food chain (Fig. 13.1). Each step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level. The autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level. They fix up the solar energy and make it available for\nheterotrophs or the consumers. The herbivores or the primary\nconsumers come at the second, small carnivores or the\nsecondary consumers at the third and larger carnivores or\nthe tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level (Fig. 13.2). We know that the food we eat acts as a fuel to provide us\nenergy to do work. Thus the interactions among various\ncomponents of the environment involves flow of energy from\none component of the system to another. As we have studied,\nthe autotrophs capture the energy present in sunlight and\nconvert it into chemical energy. This energy supports all the\nactivities of the living world. From autotrophs, the energy goes\nto the heterotrophs and decomposers. However, as we saw in\nthe previous Chapter on \u2018Sources of Energy\u2019, when one form\nof energy is changed to another, some energy is lost to the\nenvironment in forms which cannot be used again. The flow\nof energy between various components of the environment\nhas been extensively studied and it has been found that \u2013\nn\nThe green plants in a terrestrial ecosystem capture about\n1% of the energy of sunlight that falls on their leaves and convert it\ninto food energy."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 283, "content": "n\nWhen green plants are eaten by primary consumers, a great deal\nof energy is lost as heat to the environment, some amount goes\ninto digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth\nand reproduction. An average of 10% of the food eaten is turned\ninto its own body and made available for the next level of\nconsumers. n\nTherefore, 10% can be taken as the average value for the amount\nof organic matter that is present at each step and reaches the next\nlevel of consumers. n\nSince so little energy is available for the next level of consumers,\nfood chains generally consist of only three or four steps. The loss\nof energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy\nremains after four trophic levels. n\nThere are generally a greater number of individuals at the lower\ntrophic levels of an ecosystem, the greatest number is of the\nproducers. n\nThe length and complexity of food chains vary greatly. Each organism\nis generally eaten by two or more other kinds of organisms which in\nturn are eaten by several other organisms. So instead of a straight\nline food chain, the relationship can be shown as a series of branching\nlines called a food web (Fig. 13.3).

Secondly, the energy available at each trophic\nlevel gets diminished progressively due to loss\nof energy at each level. Another interesting aspect of food chain\nis how unknowingly some harmful\nchemicals enter our bodies through the food\nchain. You have read in Class IX how water\ngets polluted. One of the reasons is the use of\nseveral pesticides and other chemicals to\nprotect our crops from diseases and pests. These chemicals are either washed down into\nthe soil or into the water bodies. From the\nsoil, these are absorbed by the plants along\nwith water and minerals, and from the water\nbodies these are taken up by aquatic plants\nFigure 13.4  \nFigure 13.4  \nFigure 13.4  \nFigure 13.4  \nFigure 13.4  Diagram showing flow of energy in an ecosystem\nFigure 13.3\nFigure 13.3\nFigure 13.3\nFigure 13.3\nFigure 13.3\nFood web, consisting of\nmany food chains\nReprint 2025-26\nScience\n212\nActivity 13.3\nActivity 13.3\nActivity 13.3\nActivity 13.3\nActivity 13.3\nand animals.
