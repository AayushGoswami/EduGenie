We restricted ourselves to simpler situations of rigid bodies. A rigid body generally means a hard solid object having a definite shape and size. But in reality, bodies can be stretched, compressed and bent. Even the appreciably rigid steel bar can be deformed when a sufficiently large external force is applied on it. This means that solid bodies are not perfectly rigid. A solid has definite shape and size. In order to change (or deform) the shape or size of a body, a force is required. If you stretch a helical spring by gently pulling its ends, the length of the spring increases slightly. When you leave the ends of the spring, it regains its original size and shape. The property of a body, by virtue of which it tends to regain its original size and shape when the applied force is removed, is known as elasticity and the deformation caused is known as elastic deformation. However, if you apply force to a lump of putty or mud, they have no gross tendency to regain their previous shape, and they get permanently deformed. Such substances are called plastic and this property is called plasticity. Putty and mud are close to ideal plastics. The elastic behaviour of materials plays an important role in engineering design. For example, while designing a building, knowledge of elastic properties of materials like steel, concrete etc. is essential. The same is true in the design of bridges, automobiles, ropeways etc. One could also ask \u2014 Can we design an aeroplane which is very light but sufficiently strong?"}

The deformation may not be noticeable visually in many materials but it is there. When a body is subjected to a deforming force, a restoring force is developed in the body. This restoring force is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the applied force. The restoring force per unit area is known as stress. If F is the force applied normal to the cross\u2013section and A is the area of cross section of the body, Magnitude of the stress = F/A (8.1) The SI unit of stress is N m\u20132 or pascal (Pa) and its dimensional formula is [ ML\u20131T\u20132 ]. There are three ways in which a solid may change its dimensions when an external force acts on it. These are shown in Fig. 8.1. In Fig.8.1(a), a cylinder is stretched by two equal forces applied normal to its cross-sectional area. The restoring force per unit area in this case is called tensile stress."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 2, "content": "If the cylinder is compressed under the action of applied forces, the restoring force per unit area is known as compressive stress. Tensile or compressive stress can also be termed as longitudinal stress. In both the cases, there is a change in the length of the cylinder. The change in the length \u2206L to the original length L of the body (cylinder in this case) is known as longitudinal strain. Longitudinal strain \u2206 = L L (8.2) However, if two equal and opposite deforming forces are applied parallel to the cross-sectional area of the cylinder, as shown in Fig. 8.1(b), there is relative displacement between the opposite faces of the cylinder. The restoring force per unit area developed due to the applied tangential force is known as tangential or shearing stress. As a result of applied tangential force, there is a relative displacement \u2206x between opposite faces of the cylinder as shown in the Fig. 8.1(b). The strain so produced is known as shearing strain and it is defined as the ratio of relative displacement of the faces \u2206x to the length of the cylinder L. Shearing strain \u2206 = x L = tan \u03b8 (8.3) where \u03b8 is the angular displacement of the cylinder from the vertical (original position of the cylinder). Usually \u03b8 is very small, tan \u03b8 is nearly equal to angle \u03b8, (if \u03b8 = 10\u00b0, for example, there is only 1% difference between \u03b8 and tan \u03b8). It can also be visualised, when a book is pressed with the hand and pushed horizontally, as shown in Fig. 8.2 (c).

The body develops internal restoring forces that are equal and opposite to the forces applied by the fluid (the body restores its original shape and size when taken out from the fluid). The internal restoring force per unit area in this case is known as hydraulic stress and in magnitude is equal to the hydraulic pressure (applied force per unit area). The strain produced by a hydraulic pressure is called volume strain and is defined as the ratio of change in volume (\u2206V) to the original volume (V). Volume strain \u2206 = V V (8.5) Since the strain is a ratio of change in dimension to the original dimension, it has no units or dimensional formula. 8.3 HOOKE\u2019S LAW Stress and strain take different forms in the situations depicted in the Fig. (8.1). For small deformations the stress and strain are proportional to each other. This is known as Hooke\u2019s law. Thus, stress \u221d strain stress = k \u00d7 strain (8.6) where k is the proportionality constant and is known as modulus of elasticity."}

However, there are some materials which do not exhibit this linear relationship. 8.4 STRESS-STRAIN CURVE The relation between the stress and the strain for a given material under tensile stress can be found experimentally. In a standard test of tensile properties, a test cylinder or a wire is stretched by an applied force. The fractional change in length (the strain) and the applied force needed to cause the strain are recorded. The applied force is gradually increased in steps and the change in length is noted. A graph is plotted between the stress (which is equal in magnitude to the applied force per unit area) and the strain produced. A typical graph for a metal is shown in Fig. 8.2. Analogous graphs for compression and shear stress may also be obtained. The stress-strain curves vary from material to material. These curves help us to understand how a given material deforms with increasing loads. From the graph, we can see that in the region between O to A, the curve is linear. In this region, Hooke\u2019s law is obeyed. The body regains its original dimensions when the applied force is removed. In this region, the solid behaves as an elastic body. In the region from A to B, stress and strain are not proportional. Nevertheless, the body still returns to its original dimension when the load is removed. The point B in the curve is known as yield point (also known as elastic limit) and the corresponding stress is known as yield strength (\u03c3y) of the material. If the load is increased further, the stress developed exceeds the yield strength and strain increases rapidly even for a small change in the stress."}

When the load is removed, say at some point C between B and D, the body does not regain its original dimension. In this case, even when the stress is zero, the strain is not zero. The material is said to have a permanent set. The deformation is said to be plastic deformation. The point D on the graph is the ultimate tensile strength (\u03c3u) of the material. Beyond this point, additional strain is produced even by a reduced applied force and fracture occurs at point E. If the ultimate strength and fracture points D and E are close, the material is said to be brittle. If they are far apart, the material is said to be ductile.

For example, rubber can be pulled to several times its original length and still returns to its original shape. Fig. 8.3 shows stress-strain curve for the elastic tissue of aorta, present in the heart. Note that although elastic region is very large, the material does not obey Hooke\u2019s law over most of the region. Secondly, there is no well defined plastic region. Substances like tissue of aorta, rubber etc. which can be stretched to cause large strains are called elastomers. 8.5 ELASTIC MODULI The proportional region within the elastic limit of the stress-strain curve (region OA in Fig. 8.2) is of great importance for structural and manufacturing engineering designs. The ratio of stress and strain, called modulus of elasticity, is found to be a characteristic of the material."}

Generally a large margin of safety (of about a factor of ten in the load) is provided. Thus a thicker rope of radius about 3 cm is recommended. A single wire of this radius would practically be a rigid rod. So the ropes are always made of a number of thin wires braided together, like in pigtails, for ease in manufacture, flexibility and strength. A bridge has to be designed such that it can withstand the load of the flowing traffic, the force of winds and its own weight. Similarly, in the design of buildings the use of beams and columns is very common. In both the cases, the overcoming of the problem of bending of beam under a load is of prime importance. The beam should not bend too much or break. Let us consider the case of a beam loaded at the centre and supported near its ends as shown in Fig. 8.6."}

From Eq. (8.16), we see that to reduce the bending for a given load, one should use a material with a large Young\u2019s modulus Y. For a given material, increasing the depth d rather than the breadth b is more effective in reducing the bending, since \u03b4 is proportional to d -3 and only to b-1(of course the length l of the span should be as small as possible). But on increasing the depth, unless the load is exactly at the right place (difficult to arrange in a bridge with moving traffic), the deep bar may bend as shown in Fig. 8.7(b). This is called buckling. To avoid this, a common compromise is the cross-sectional shape shown in Fig. 8.7(c). This section provides a large load- bearing surface and enough depth to prevent bending. This shape reduces the weight of the beam without sacrificing the strength and hence reduces the cost. Fig. 8.6 A beam supported at the ends and loaded at the centre.

Stress is the restoring force per unit area and strain is the fractional change in dimension. In general there are three types of stresses (a) tensile stress \u2014 longitudinal stress (associated with stretching) or compressive stress (associated with compression), (b) shearing stress, and (c) hydraulic stress. 2. For small deformations, stress is directly proportional to the strain for many materials. This is known as Hooke\u2019s law. The constant of proportionality is called modulus of elasticity. Three elastic moduli viz., Young\u2019s modulus, shear modulus and bulk modulus are used to describe the elastic behaviour of objects as they respond to deforming forces that act on them. A class of solids called elastomers does not obey Hooke\u2019s law. 3. When an object is under tension or compression, the Hooke\u2019s law takes the form F/A = Y\u2206L/L where \u2206L/L is the tensile or compressive strain of the object, F is the magnitude of the applied force causing the strain, A is the cross-sectional area over which F is applied (perpendicular to A) and Y is the Young\u2019s modulus for the object. The stress is F/A. 4. A pair of forces when applied parallel to the upper and lower faces, the solid deforms so that the upper face moves sideways with respect to the lower. The horizontal displacement \u2206L of the upper face is perpendicular to the vertical height L. This type of deformation is called shear and the corresponding stress is the shearing stress. This type of stress is possible only in solids."}

When an object undergoes hydraulic compression due to a stress exerted by a surrounding fluid, the Hooke\u2019s law takes the form p = B (\u2206V/V), where p is the pressure (hydraulic stress) on the object due to the fluid, \u2206V/V (the volume strain) is the absolute fractional change in the object\u2019s volume due to that pressure and B is the bulk modulus of the object.

The answer to the question why the maximum height of a mountain on earth is ~10 km can also be provided by considering the elastic properties of rocks. A mountain base is not under uniform compression and this provides some shearing stress to the rocks under which they can flow. The stress due to all the material on the top should be less than the critical shearing stress at which the rocks flow. At the bottom of a mountain of height h, the force per unit area due to the weight of the mountain is h\u03c1g where \u03c1 is the density of the material of the mountain and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The material at the bottom experiences this force in the vertical direction, and the sides of the mountain are free. Therefore, this is not a case of pressure or bulk compression. There is a shear component, approximately h\u03c1g itself. Now the elastic limit for a typical rock is 30 \u00d7 107 N m-2."}

In the case of a wire, suspended from celing and stretched under the action of a weight (F) suspended from its other end, the force exerted by the ceiling on it is equal and opposite to the weight. However, the tension at any cross-section A of the wire is just F and not 2F. Hence, tensile stress which is equal to the tension per unit area is equal to F/A. 2. Hooke\u2019s law is valid only in the linear part of stress-strain curve. 3. The Young\u2019s modulus and shear modulus are relevant only for solids since only solids have lengths and shapes. 4. Bulk modulus is relevant for solids, liquid and gases. It refers to the change in volume when every part of the body is under the uniform stress so that the shape of the body remains unchanged. 5. Metals have larger values of Young\u2019s modulus than alloys and elastomers. A material with large value of Young\u2019s modulus requires a large force to produce small changes in its length. 6. In daily life, we feel that a material which stretches more is more elastic, but it a is misnomer. In fact material which stretches to a lesser extent for a given load is considered to be more elastic. 7. In general, a deforming force in one direction can produce strains in other directions also."}

Liquids and gases can flow and are therefore, called fluids. It is this property that distinguishes liquids and gases from solids in a basic way. Fluids are everywhere around us. Earth has an envelop of air and two-thirds of its surface is covered with water. Water is not only necessary for our existence; every mammalian body constitute mostly of water. All the processes occurring in living beings including plants are mediated by fluids. Thus understanding the behaviour and properties of fluids is important. How are fluids different from solids? What is common in liquids and gases?"}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 23, "content": "Unlike a solid, a fluid has no definite shape of its own. Solids and liquids have a fixed volume, whereas a gas fills the entire volume of its container. We have learnt in the previous chapter that the volume of solids can be changed by stress. The volume of solid, liquid or gas depends on the stress or pressure acting on it. When we talk about fixed volume of solid or liquid, we mean its volume under atmospheric pressure. The difference between gases and solids or liquids is that for solids or liquids the change in volume due to change of external pressure is rather small. In other words solids and liquids have much lower compressibility as compared to gases. Shear stress can change the shape of a solid keeping its volume fixed. The key property of fluids is that they offer very little resistance to shear stress; their shape changes by application of very small shear stress. The shearing stress of fluids is about million times smaller than that of solids. 9.2 PRESSURE A sharp needle when pressed against our skin pierces it.

{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 24, "content": "This impact is known as pressure. When an object is submerged in a fluid at rest, the fluid exerts a force on its surface. This force is always normal to the object\u2019s surface. This is so because if there were a component of force parallel to the surface, the object will also exert a force on the fluid parallel to it; as a consequence of Newton\u2019s third law. This force will cause the fluid to flow parallel to the surface. Since the fluid is at rest, this cannot happen. Hence, the force exerted by the fluid at rest has to be perpendicular to the surface in contact with it. This is shown in Fig.9.1(a). The normal force exerted by the fluid at a point may be measured. An idealised form of one such pressure-measuring device is shown in Fig. 9.1(b). It consists of an evacuated chamber with a spring that is calibrated to measure the force acting on the piston. This device is placed at a point inside the fluid. The inward force exerted by the fluid on the piston is balanced by the outward spring force and is thereby measured. If F is the magnitude of this normal force on the piston of area A then the average pressure Pav is defined as the normal force acting per unit area. P F A av = (9.1) In principle, the piston area can be made arbitrarily small. The pressure is then defined in a limiting sense as P = lim \u2206A 0 \u2192 \u2206 \u2206 F A (9.2) Pressure is a scalar quantity.

It has been named as pascal (Pa) in honour of the French scientist Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) who carried out pioneering studies on fluid pressure. A common unit of pressure is the atmosphere (atm), i.e. the pressure exerted by the atmosphere at sea level (1 atm = 1.013 \u00d7 105 Pa). Another quantity, that is indispensable in describing fluids, is the density \u03c1. For a fluid of mass m occupying volume V, \u03c1 = m V (9.3) The dimensions of density are [ML\u20133]. Its SI unit is kg m\u20133. It is a positive scalar quantity. A liquid is largely incompressible and its density is therefore, nearly constant at all pressures. Gases, on the other hand exhibit a large variation in densities with pressure. The density of water at 4oC (277 K) is 1.0 \u00d7 103 kg m\u20133.

This fact may be demonstrated in a simple way. Fig. 9.2 shows an element in the interior of a fluid at rest. This element ABC-DEF is in the form of a right-angled prism. In principle, this prismatic element is very small so that every part of it can be considered at the same depth from the liquid surface and therefore, the effect of the gravity is the same at all these points. But for clarity we have enlarged this element. The forces on this element are those exerted by the rest of the fluid and they must be normal to the surfaces of the element as discussed above. Thus, the fluid exerts pressures Pa, Pb and Pc on this element of area corresponding to the normal forces Fa, Fb and Fc as shown in Fig. 9.2 on the faces BEFC, ADFC and ADEB denoted by Aa, Ab and Ac respectively."}

It again reminds us that like other types of stress, pressure is not a vector quantity. No direction can be assigned to it. The force against any area within (or bounding) a fluid at rest and under pressure is normal to the area, regardless of the orientation of the area. Now consider a fluid element in the form of a horizontal bar of uniform cross-section. The bar is in equilibrium. The horizontal forces exerted at its two ends must be balanced or the pressure at the two ends should be equal. This proves that for a liquid in equilibrium the pressure is same at all points in a horizontal plane. Suppose the pressure were not equal in different parts of the fluid, then there would be a flow as the fluid will have some net force acting on it. Hence in the absence of flow the pressure in the fluid must be same everywhere in a horizontal plane. 9.2.2 Variation of Pressure with Depth Consider a fluid at rest in a container. In Fig. 9.3 point 1 is at height h above a point 2. The pressures at points 1 and 2 are P1 and P2 respectively. Consider a cylindrical element of fluid having area of base A and height h.

The pressure P = 1 1 F A is transmitted throughout the liquid to the larger cylinder attached with a larger piston of area A2, which results in an upward force of P \u00d7 A2. Therefore, the piston is capable of supporting a large force (large weight of, say a car, or a truck, placed on the platform) F2 = PA2 = 1 2 1 F A A . By changing the force at A1, the platform can be moved up or down. Thus, the applied force has been increased by a factor of 2 1 A A and this factor is the mechanical advantage of the device. The example below clarifies it. Fig 9.6 (a) Whenever external pressure is applied on any part of a fluid in a vessel, it is equally transmitted in all directions. This indicates that when the pressure on the cylinder was increased, it was distributed uniformly throughout. We can say whenever external pressure is applied on any part of a fluid contained in a vessel, it is transmitted undiminished and equally in all directions. This is another form of the Pascal\u2019s law and it has many applications in daily life.

The study of the fluids in motion is known as fluid dynamics. When a water tap is turned on slowly, the water flow is smooth initially, but loses its smoothness when the speed of the outflow is increased. In studying the motion of fluids, we focus our attention on what is happening to various fluid particles at a particular point in space at a particular time. The flow of the fluid is said to be steady if at any given point, the velocity of each passing fluid particle remains constant in time. This does not mean that the velocity at different points in space is same. The velocity of a particular particle may change as it moves from one point to another. That is, at some other point the particle may have a different velocity, but every other particle which passes the second point behaves exactly as the previous particle that has just passed that point. Each particle follows a smooth path, and the paths of the particles do not cross each other. Fig. 9.7 The meaning of streamlines. (a) A typical trajectory of a fluid particle. (b) A region of streamline flow. The path taken by a fluid particle under a steady flow is a streamline."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 36, "content": "It is defined as a curve whose tangent at any point is in the direction of the fluid velocity at that point. Consider the path of a particle as shown in Fig.9.7 (a), the curve describes how a fluid particle moves with time. The curve PQ is like a Reprint 2025-26 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 187 permanent map of fluid flow, indicating how the fluid streams. No two streamlines can cross, for if they do, an oncoming fluid particle can go either one way or the other and the flow would not be steady. Hence, in steady flow, the map of flow is stationary in time. How do we draw closely spaced streamlines ? If we intend to show streamline of every flowing particle, we would end up with a continuum of lines. Consider planes perpendicular to the direction of fluid flow e.g., at three points P, R and Q in Fig.9.7 (b). The plane pieces are so chosen that their boundaries be determined by the same set of streamlines. This means that number of fluid particles crossing the surfaces as indicated at P, R and Q is the same. If area of cross-sections at these points are AP,AR and AQ and speeds of fluid particles are vP, vR and vQ, then mass of fluid \u2206mP crossing at AP in a small interval of time \u2206t is \u03c1PAPvP \u2206t. Similarly mass of fluid \u2206mR flowing or crossing at AR in a small interval of time \u2206t is \u03c1RARvR \u2206t and mass of fluid \u2206mQ is \u03c1QAQvQ \u2206t crossing at AQ.

In general Av = constant (9.11) Av gives the volume flux or flow rate and remains constant throughout the pipe of flow. Thus, at narrower portions where the streamlines are closely spaced, velocity increases and its vice versa. From (Fig 9.7b) it is clear that AR > AQ or vR < vQ, the fluid is accelerated while passing from R to Q. This is associated with a change in pressure in fluid flow in horizontal pipes. Steady flow is achieved at low flow speeds. Beyond a limiting value, called critical speed, this flow loses steadiness and becomes turbulent. One sees this when a fast flowing stream encounters rocks, small foamy whirlpool-like regions called \u2018white water rapids are formed. Figure 9.8 displays streamlines for some typical flows. For example, Fig. 9.8(a) describes a laminar flow where the velocities at different points in the fluid may have different magnitudes but their directions are parallel.

But we can obtain some useful properties for steady or streamline flows using the conservation of energy. Consider a fluid moving in a pipe of varying cross-sectional area. Let the pipe be at varying heights as shown in Fig. 9.9."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 38, "content": "We now suppose that an incompressible fluid is flowing through the pipe in a steady flow. Its velocity must change as a consequence of equation of continuity. A force is required to produce this acceleration, which is caused by the fluid surrounding it, the pressure must be different in different regions. Bernoulli\u2019s equation is a general expression that relates the pressure difference between two points in a pipe to both velocity changes (kinetic energy change) and elevation (height) changes (potential energy change). The Swiss Physicist Daniel Bernoulli developed this relationship in 1738. Consider the flow at two regions 1 (i.e., BC) and 2 (i.e., DE). Consider the fluid initially lying between B and D. In an infinitesimal time interval \u2206t, this fluid would have moved. Suppose v1 is the speed at B and v2 at D, then fluid initially at B has moved a distance v1\u2206t to C (v1\u2206t is small enough to assume constant cross-section along BC). In the same interval \u2206t the fluid initially at D moves to E, a distance equal to v2\u2206t. Pressures P1 and P2 act as shown on the plane faces of areas A1 and A2 binding the two regions. The work done on the fluid at left end (BC) is W1 = P1A1(v1\u2206t) = P1\u2206V. Since the same volume \u2206V passes through both the regions (from the equation of continuity) the work done by the fluid at the other end (DE) is W2 = P2A2(v2\u2206t) = P2\u2206V or, Reprint 2025-26 188 PHYSICS the work done on the fluid is \u2013P2\u2206V. So the total work done on the fluid is W1 \u2013 W2 = (P1\u2212 P2) \u2206V Part of this work goes into changing the kinetic energy of the fluid, and part goes into changing the gravitational potential energy."}

Note that in applying the energy conservation principle, there is an assumption that no energy is lost due to friction. But in fact, when fluids flow, some energy does get lost due to internal friction. This arises due to the fact that in a fluid flow, the different layers of the fluid flow with different velocities. These layers exert frictional forces on each other resulting in a loss of energy."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 40, "content": "This property of the fluid is called viscosity and is discussed in more detail in a later section. The lost kinetic energy of the fluid gets converted into heat energy. Thus, Bernoulli\u2019s equation ideally applies to fluids with zero viscosity or non- viscous fluids. Another restriction on application of Bernoulli theorem is that the fluids must be incompressible, as the elastic energy of the fluid is also not taken into consideration. In practice, it has a large number of useful applications and can help explain a wide variety of phenomena for low viscosity incompressible fluids. Bernoulli\u2019s equation also does not hold for non- steady or turbulent flows, because in that situation velocity and pressure are constantly fluctuating in time. When a fluid is at rest i.e., its velocity is zero everywhere, Bernoulli\u2019s equation becomes P1 + \u03c1gh1 = P2 + \u03c1gh2 (P1\u2212 P2) = \u03c1g (h2 \u2212 h1) which is same as Eq.

Torricelli discovered that the speed of efflux from an open tank is given by a formula identical to that of a freely falling body. Consider a tank containing a liquid of density \u03c1 with a small hole in its side at a height y1 from the bottom (see Fig. 9.10). The air above the liquid, whose surface is at height y2, is at pressure P. From the equation of continuity [Eq.

Equation (9.15) represents Torricelli\u2019s law. 9.4.2 Dynamic Lift Dynamic lift is the force that acts on a body, such as airplane wing, a hydrofoil or a spinning ball, by virtue of its motion through a fluid. In many games such as cricket, tennis, baseball, or golf, we notice that a spinning ball deviates from its parabolic trajectory as it moves through air. This deviation can be partly explained on the basis of Bernoulli\u2019s principle. (i) Ball moving without spin: Fig. 9.11(a) shows the streamlines around a non-spinning ball moving relative to a fluid. From the symmetry of streamlines it is clear that the velocity of fluid (air) above and below the ball at corresponding points is the same resulting in zero pressure difference."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 42, "content": "The air therefore, exerts no upward or downward force on the ball. (ii) Ball moving with spin: A ball which is spinning drags air along with it. If the surface is rough more air will be dragged. Fig 9.11(b) shows the streamlines of air for a ball which is moving and spinning at the same time. The ball is moving forward and relative to it the air is moving backwards. Therefore, the velocity of air above the ball relative to the ball is larger and below it is smaller (see Section 9.3). The stream lines, thus, get crowded above and rarified below. This difference in the velocities of air results in the pressure difference between the lower and upper faces and there is a net upward force on the ball. This dynamic lift due to spining is called Magnus effect. Aerofoil or lift on aircraft wing: Figure 9.11 (c) shows an aerofoil, which is a solid piece shaped to provide an upward dynamic lift when it moves horizontally through air. The cross-section of the wings of an aeroplane looks somewhat like the aerofoil shown in Fig. 9.11 (c) with streamlines around it. When the aerofoil moves against the wind, the orientation of the wing relative to flow direction causes the streamlines to crowd together above the wing more than those below it. The flow speed on top is higher than that below it. There is an upward force resulting in a dynamic lift of the wings and this balances the weight of the plane. The following example illustrates this. Fig. 9.10 Torricelli\u2019s law. The speed of efflux, v1, from the side of the container is given by the application of Bernoulli\u2019s equation."}

This resistance to fluid motion is like an internal friction analogous to friction when a solid moves on a surface. It is called viscosity. This force exists when there is relative motion between layers of the liquid. Suppose we consider a fluid like oil enclosed between two glass plates as shown in Fig. 9.12 (a). The bottom plate is fixed while the top plate is moved with a constant velocity v relative to the fixed plate. If oil is replaced by honey, a greater force is required to move the plate with the same velocity. Hence we say that honey is more viscous than oil. The fluid in contact with a surface has the same velocity as that of the surfaces. Hence, the layer of the liquid in contact with top surface moves with a velocity v and the layer of the liquid in contact with the fixed surface is stationary. The velocities of layers increase uniformly from bottom (zero velocity) to the top layer (velocity v). For any layer of liquid, its upper layer pulls it forward while lower layer pulls it backward. This results in force between the layers.

The other quantities on which the force F depends are viscosity \u03b7 of the fluid and radius a of the sphere. Sir George G.

This law is an interesting example of retarding force, which is proportional to velocity. We can study its consequences on an object falling through a viscous medium. We consider a raindrop in air. It accelerates initially due to gravity. As the velocity increases, the retarding force also increases. Finally, when viscous force plus buoyant force becomes equal to the force due to gravity, the net force becomes zero and so does the acceleration. The sphere (raindrop) then descends with a constant velocity. Thus, in equilibrium, this terminal velocity vt is given by 6\u03c0\u03b7avt = (4\u03c0/3) a3 (\u03c1-\u03c3)g where \u03c1 and \u03c3 are mass densities of sphere and the fluid, respectively.

There is some negative potential energy due to these, but obviously it is less than that of a molecule in bulk, i.e., the one fully inside. Approximately it is half of the latter. Thus, molecules on a liquid surface have some extra energy in comparison to molecules in the interior. A liquid, thus, tends to have the least surface area which external conditions permit. Increasing surface area requires energy. Most surface phenomenon can be understood in terms of this fact. What is the energy required for having a molecule at the surface? As mentioned above, roughly it is half the energy required to remove it entirely from the liquid i.e., half the heat of evaporation. Finally, what is a surface? Since a liquid consists of molecules moving about, there cannot be a perfectly sharp surface."}

All these and many more such experiences are related with the free surfaces of liquids. As liquids have no definite shape but have a definite volume, they acquire a free surface when poured in a container. These surfaces possess some additional energy. This phenomenon is known as surface tension and it is concerned with only liquid as gases do not have free surfaces. Let us now understand this phenomena. 9.6.1 Surface Energy A liquid stays together because of attraction between molecules. Consider a molecule well inside a liquid. The intermolecular distances are such that it is attracted to all the surrounding molecules [Fig. 9.14(a)]. This attraction results in a negative potential energy for the molecule, which depends on the number and distribution of molecules around the chosen one. But the average potential energy of all the molecules is the same. This is supported by the fact that to take a collection of such molecules (the liquid) and to disperse them far away from each other in order to evaporate or vaporise, the heat of evaporation required is quite large."}

(a) A film in equilibrium; (b) The film stretched an extra distance. Suppose that we move the bar by a small distance d as shown. Since the area of the surface increases, the system now has more energy, this means that some work has been done against an internal force. Let this internal force be F, the work done by the applied force is F.d = Fd. From conservation of energy, this is stored as additional energy in the film. If the surface energy of the film is S per unit area, the extra area is 2dl. A film has two sides and the liquid in between, so there are two surfaces and the extra energy is S (2dl) = Fd (9.19) Or, S=Fd/2dl = F/2l (9.20) This quantity S is the magnitude of surface tension. It is equal to the surface energy per unit area of the liquid interface and is also equal to the force per unit length exerted by the fluid on the movable bar. So far we have talked about the surface of one liquid. More generally, we need to consider fluid surface in contact with other fluids or solid surfaces. The surface energy in that case depends on the materials on both sides of the surface. For example, if the molecules of the materials attract each other, surface energy is reduced while if they repel each other the surface energy is increased. Thus, more appropriately, the surface energy is the energy of the interface between two materials and depends on both of them."}

(ii) At any point on the interface besides the boundary, we can draw a line and imagine equal and opposite surface tension forces S per unit length of the line acting perpendicular to the line, in the plane of the interface. The line is in equilibrium. To be more specific, imagine a line of atoms or molecules at the surface. The atoms to the left pull the line towards them; those to the right pull it towards them! This line of atoms is in equilibrium under tension. If the line really marks the end of the interface, as in Figure 9.14 (a) and (b) there is only the force S per unit length acting inwards.

A flat vertical glass plate, below which a vessel of some liquid is kept, forms one arm of the balance. The plate is balanced by weights on the other side, with its horizontal edge just over water. The vessel is raised slightly till the liquid just touches the glass plate and pulls it down a little because of surface tension. Weights are added till the plate just clears water. Fig. 9.16 Measuring Surface Tension. Suppose the additional weight required is W. Then from Eq. 9.20 and the discussion given there, the surface tension of the liquid-air interface is Sla = (W/2l) = (mg/2l ) (9.21) where m is the extra mass and l is the length of the plate edge. The subscript (la) emphasises the fact that the liquid-air interface tension is involved. 9.6.3 Angle of Contact The surface of liquid near the plane of contact, with another medium is in general curved. The angle between tangent to the liquid surface at the point of contact and solid surface inside the liquid is termed as angle of contact. It is denoted by \u03b8. It is different at interfaces of different pairs of liquids and solids. The value of \u03b8 determines whether a liquid will spread on the surface of a solid or it will form droplets on it. For example, water forms droplets on lotus leaf as shown in Fig. 9.17 (a) while spreads over a clean plastic plate as shown in Fig. 9.17(b).

{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 53, "content": "We consider the three interfacial tensions at all the three interfaces, liquid-air, solid-air and solid-liquid denoted by Sla, Ssa and Ssl , respectively as given in Fig. 9.17 (a) and (b). At the line of contact, the surface forces between the three media must be in equilibrium. From the Fig. 9.17(b) the following relation is easily derived. Sla cos \u03b8 + Ssl = Ssa (9.22) The angle of contact is an obtuse angle if Ssl > Sla as in the case of water-leaf interface while it is an acute angle if Ssl < Sla as in the case of water-plastic interface. When \u03b8 is an obtuse angle then molecules of liquids are attracted strongly to themselves and weakly to those of solid, it costs a lot of energy to create a liquid-solid surface, and liquid then does not wet the solid. This is what happens with water on a waxy or oily surface, and with mercury on Reprint 2025-26 196 PHYSICS any surface. On the other hand, if the molecules of the liquid are strongly attracted to those of the solid, this will reduce Ssl and therefore, cos \u03b8 may increase or \u03b8 may decrease. In this case \u03b8 is an acute angle. This is what happens for water on glass or on plastic and for kerosene oil on virtually anything (it just spreads). Soaps, detergents and dying substances are wetting agents. When they are added the angle of contact becomes small so that these may penetrate well and become effective. Water proofing agents on the other hand are added to create a large angle of contact between the water and fibres. 9.6.4 Drops and Bubbles One consequence of surface tension is that free liquid drops and bubbles are spherical if effects of gravity can be neglected."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 54, "content": "You must have seen this especially clearly in small drops just formed in a high-speed spray or jet, and in soap bubbles blown by most of us in childhood. Why are drops and bubbles spherical? What keeps soap bubbles stable? As we have been saying repeatedly, a liquid- air interface has energy, so for a given volume the surface with minimum energy is the one with the least area. The sphere has this property. Though it is out of the scope of this book, but you can check that a sphere is better than at least a cube in this respect! So, if gravity and other forces (e.g. air resistance) were ineffective, liquid drops would be spherical. Another interesting consequence of surface tension is that the pressure inside a spherical drop Fig. 9.18(a) is more than the pressure outside. Suppose a spherical drop of radius r is in equilibrium. If its radius increase by \u2206r. The extra surface energy is [4\u03c0(r + \u2206r) 2- 4\u03c0r2] Sla = 8\u03c0r \u2206r Sla (9.23) If the drop is in equilibrium this energy cost is balanced by the energy gain due to expansion under the pressure difference (Pi \u2013 Po) between the inside of the bubble and the outside. The work done is W = (Pi \u2013 Po) 4\u03c0r2\u2206r (9.24) so that (Pi \u2013 Po) = (2 Sla/ r) (9.25) In general, for a liquid-gas interface, the convex side has a higher pressure than the concave side. For example, an air bubble in a liquid, would have higher pressure inside it. See Fig 9.18 (b). Fig. 9.18 Drop, cavity and bubble of radius r. A bubble Fig 9.18 (c) differs from a drop and a cavity; in this it has two interfaces."}

A little extra air pressure is needed inside! 9.6.5 Capillary Rise One consequence of the pressure difference across a curved liquid-air interface is the well- known effect that water rises up in a narrow tube in spite of gravity. The word capilla means hair in Latin; if the tube were hair thin, the rise would be very large. To see this, consider a vertical capillary tube of circular cross section (radius a) inserted into an open vessel of water (Fig. 9.19).

Reprint 2025-26 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 197 \u22b3 glass is acute. Thus the surface of water in the capillary is concave. This means that there is a pressure difference between the two sides of the top surface. This is given by (Pi \u2013 Po) =(2S/r) = 2S/(a sec \u03b8 ) = (2S/a) cos \u03b8 (9.27) Thus the pressure of the water inside the tube, just at the meniscus (air-water interface) is less than the atmospheric pressure. Consider the two points A and B in Fig. 9.19(a). They must be at the same pressure, namely P0 + h \u03c1 g = Pi = PA (9.28) where \u03c1 is the density of water and h is called the capillary rise [Fig. 9.19(a)]. Using Eq.

You should note there is only one liquid surface in this case. (For a bubble of liquid in a gas, there are two liquid surfaces, so the formula for excess pressure in that case is 4S/r.) The radius of the bubble is r. Now the pressure outside the bubble Po equals atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to 8.00 cm of water column."}

The fluid does not have any resistance to change of its shape. Thus, the shape of a fluid is governed by the shape of its container. 2. A liquid is incompressible and has a free surface of its own. A gas is compressible and it expands to occupy all the space available to it. 3.

The volume of an incompressible fluid passing any point every second in a pipe of non uniform crossection is the same in the steady flow. v A = constant ( v is the velocity and A is the area of crossection) The equation is due to mass conservation in incompressible fluid flow. 8.

The definition of the pressure as \u201cforce per unit area\u201d may give one false impression that pressure is a vector. The \u201cforce\u201d in the numerator of the definition is the component of the force normal to the area upon which it is impressed. While describing fluids as a concept, shift from particle and rigid body mechanics is required. We are concerned with properties that vary from point to point in the fluid. 2. One should not think of pressure of a fluid as being exerted only on a solid like the walls of a container or a piece of solid matter immersed in the fluid. Pressure exists at all points in a fluid. An element of a fluid (such as the one shown in Fig. 9.4) is in equilibrium because the pressures exerted on the various faces are equal. Reprint 2025-26 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 199 3.

As the temperature rises the atoms of the liquid become more mobile and the coefficient of viscosity, \u03b7 falls. In a gas the temperature rise increases the random motion of atoms and \u03b7 increases. 8.

Along the way, you will find out why blacksmiths heat the iron ring before fitting on the rim of a wooden wheel of a horse cart and why the wind at the beach often reverses direction after the sun goes down. You will also learn what happens when water boils or freezes, and its temperature does not change during these processes even though a great deal of heat is flowing into or out of it. 10.2 TEMPERATURE AND HEAT We can begin studying thermal properties of matter with definitions of temperature and heat. Temperature is a relative measure, or indication of hotness or coldness."}

An object that has a higher temperature than another object is said to be hotter. Note that hot and cold are relative terms, like tall and short. We can perceive temperature by touch. However, this temperature sense is somewhat unreliable and its range is too limited to be useful for scientific purposes. We know from experience that a glass of ice-cold water left on a table on a hot summer day eventually warms up whereas a cup of hot tea on the same table cools down. It means that when the temperature of body, ice-cold water or hot tea in this case, and its surrounding medium are different, heat transfer takes place between the system and the surrounding medium, until the body and the surrounding medium are at the same temperature. We also know that in the case of glass tumbler of ice-cold water, heat flows from the environment to 10.1 Introduction 10.2 Temperature and heat 10.3 Measurement of temperature 10.4 Ideal-gas equation and absolute temperature 10.5 Thermal expansion 10.6 Specific heat capacity 10.7 Calorimetry 10.8 Change of state 10.9 Heat transfer 10.10 Newton\u2019s law of cooling Summary Points to ponder Exercises Additional Exercises Reprint 2025-26 the glass tumbler, whereas in the case of hot tea, it flows from the cup of hot tea to the environment. So, we can say that heat is the form of energy transferred between two (or more) systems or a system and its surroundings by virtue of temperature difference. The SI unit of heat energy transferred is expressed in joule (J) while SI unit of temperature is Kelvin (K), and degree Celsius ( oC) is a commonly used unit of temperature."}

We will study the effect of heat on different bodies in later sections. 10.3 MEASUREMENT OF TEMPERATURE A measure of temperature is obtained using a thermometer. Many physical properties of materials change sufficiently with temperature. Some such properties are used as the basis for constructing thermometers. The commonly used property is variation of the volume of a liquid with temperature. For example, in common liquid\u2013in\u2013glass thermometers, mercury, alcohol etc., are used whose volume varies linearly with temperature over a wide range. Thermometers are calibrated so that a numerical value may be assigned to a given temperature in an appropriate scale. For the definition of any standard scale, two fixed reference points are needed. Since all substances change dimensions with temperature, an absolute reference for expansion is not available. However, the necessary fixed points may be correlated to the physical phenomena that always occur at the same temperature. The ice point and the steam point of water are two convenient fixed points and are known as the freezing and boiling points, respectively. These two points are the temperatures at which pure water freezes and boils under standard pressure. The two familiar temperature scales are the Fahrenheit temperature scale and the Celsius temperature scale. The ice and steam point have values 32 \u00b0F and 212 \u00b0F, respectively, on the Fahrenheit scale and 0 \u00b0C and 100 \u00b0C on the Celsius scale. On the Fahrenheit scale, there are 180 equal intervals between two reference points, and on the Celsius scale, there are 100.

A thermometer that uses a gas, however, gives the same readings regardless of which gas is used. Experiments show that all gases at low densities exhibit same expansion behaviour. The variables that describe the behaviour of a given quantity (mass) of gas are pressure, volume, and temperature (P, V, and T )(where T = t + 273.15; t is the temperature in \u00b0C). When temperature is held constant, the pressure and volume of a quantity of gas are related as PV = constant. This relationship is known as Boyle\u2019s law, after Robert Boyle (1627\u20131691), the English Chemist who discovered it. When the pressure is held constant, the volume of a quantity of the gas is related to the temperature as V/T = constant. This relationship is known as Charles\u2019 law, after French scientist Jacques Charles (1747\u2013 1823). Low-density gases obey these laws, which may be combined into a single THERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER 203 Reprint 2025-26 204 PHYSICS named after the British scientist Lord Kelvin.

This would allow the metallic lid to expand, thereby loosening it to unscrew easily. In case of liquids, you may have observed that mercury in a thermometer rises, when the thermometer is put in slightly warm water.

Notice that since PV = constant and V/T = constant for a given quantity of gas, then PV/T should also be a constant. This relationship is known as ideal gas law. It can be written in a more general form that applies not just to a given quantity of a single gas but to any quantity of any low-density gas and is known as ideal-gas equation: or PV = \u00b5RT (10.2) where, \u00b5 is the number of moles in the sample of gas and R is called universal gas constant: R = 8.31 J mol\u20131 K\u20131 In Eq. 10.2, we have learnt that the pressure and volume are directly proportional to temperature : PV \u221d T. This relationship allows a gas to be used to measure temperature in a constant volume gas thermometer. Holding the volume of a gas constant, it gives P \u221dT. Thus, with a constant-volume gas thermometer, temperature is read in terms of pressure."}

However, measurements on real gases deviate from the values predicted by the ideal gas law at low temperature. But the relationship is linear over a large temperature range, and it looks as though the pressure might reach zero with decreasing temperature if the gas continued to be a gas. The absolute minimum temperature for an ideal gas, therefore, inferred by extrapolating the straight line to the axis, as in Fig. 10.3. This temperature is found to be \u2013 273.15 \u00b0C and is designated as absolute zero.

Similarly, in case of gases, a balloon partially inflated in a cool room may expand to full size when placed in warm water. On the other hand, a fully inflated balloon when immersed in cold water would start shrinking due to contraction of the air inside. It is our common experience that most substances expand on heating and contract on cooling. A change in the temperature of a body causes change in its dimensions. The increase in the dimensions of a body due to the increase in its temperature is called thermal expansion. The expansion in length is called linear expansion. The expansion in area is called area expansion. The expansion in volume is called volume expansion (Fig. 10.5). Fig. 10.5 Thermal Expansion.

The volume of a given amount of water decreases as it is cooled from room temperature, until its temperature reaches 4 \u00b0C, [Fig. 10.7(a)]. Below 4 \u00b0C, the volume increases, and therefore, the density decreases [Fig. 10.7(b)]. This means that water has the maximum density at 4 \u00b0C. This property has an important environmental effect: bodies of water, such as lakes and ponds, freeze at the top first. As a lake cools toward 4 \u00b0C, water near the surface loses energy to the atmosphere, becomes denser, and sinks; the warmer, less dense water near the bottom rises. However, once the colder water on top reaches temperature below 4 \u00b0C, it becomes less dense and remains at the surface, where it freezes. If water did not have this property, lakes and ponds would freeze from the bottom up, which would destroy much of their animal and plant life. Gases, at ordinary temperature, expand more than solids and liquids. For liquids, the coefficient of volume expansion is relatively independent of the temperature. However, for gases it is dependent on temperature."}

Clearly, the rod acquires a compressive strain due to the external forces provided by the rigid support at the ends. The corresponding stress set up in the rod is called thermal stress.

Soon you will notice that bubbles begin to move upward. As the temperature is raised the motion of water particles increases till it becomes turbulent as water starts boiling. What are the factors on which the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of a substance depend? In order to answer this question in the first step, heat a given quantity of water to raise its temperature by, say 20 \u00b0C and note the time taken. Again take the same amount of water and raise its temperature by 40 \u00b0C using the same source of heat. Note the time taken by using a stopwatch.

The above observations show that the quantity of heat required to warm a given substance depends on its mass, m, the change in temperature, \u2206T and the nature of substance. The change in temperature of a substance, when a given quantity of heat is absorbed or rejected by it, is characterised by a quantity called the heat capacity of that substance. We define heat capacity, S of a substance as Q S T \u2206 = \u2206 (10.10) where \u2206Q is the amount of heat supplied to the substance to change its temperature from T to T + \u2206T. You have observed that if equal amount of heat is added to equal masses of different substances, the resulting temperature changes will not be the same. It implies that every substance has a unique value for the amount of heat absorbed or given off to change the temperature of unit mass of it by one unit.

It is defined as the amount of heat per unit mass absorbed or given off by the substance to change its temperature by one unit. It depends on the nature of the substance and its temperature. The SI unit of specific heat capacity is J kg\u20131 K\u20131. If the amount of substance is specified in terms of moles \u00b5, instead of mass m in kg, we can define heat capacity per mole of the substance by (10.12) where C is known as molar specific heat capacity of the substance.

To study the change of state on heating or cooling, let us perform the following activity. Take some cubes of ice in a beaker. Note the temperature of ice. Start heating it slowly on a constant heat source. Note the temperature after every minute. Continuously stir the mixture of water and ice. Draw a graph between temperature and time (Fig. 10.9). You will observe no change in the temperature as long as there is ice in the beaker. In the above process, the temperature of the system does not change even though heat is being continuously supplied. The heat supplied is being utilised in changing the state from solid (ice) to liquid (water).

That is, both the solid and the liquid states of the substance coexist in thermal equilibrium during the change of states from solid to liquid. The temperature at which the solid and the liquid states of the substance is in thermal equilibrium with each other is called its melting point. It is characteristic of the substance. It also depends on pressure. The melting point of a substance at standard atomspheric pressure is called its normal melting point.

This happens due to the fact that just below the wire, ice melts at lower temperature due to increase in pressure. When the wire has passed, water above the wire freezes again. Thus, the wire passes through the slab and the slab does not split. This phenomenon of refreezing is called regelation. Skating is possible on snow due to the formation of water under the skates. Water is formed due to the increase of pressure and it acts as a lubricant.

The temperature keeps on rising till it reaches nearly 100 \u00b0C when it again becomes steady. The heat supplied is now being utilised to change water from liquid state to vapour or gaseous state. The change of state from liquid to vapour (or gas) is called vaporisation. It is observed that the temperature remains constant until the entire amount of the liquid is converted into vapour. That is, both the liquid and vapour states of the substance coexist in thermal equilibrium, during the change of state from liquid to vapour.

Later, bubbles of steam will form at the bottom but as they rise to the cooler water near the top, they condense and disappear.

Fig. 10.11 Boiling process. If now the steam outlet is closed for a few seconds to increase the pressure in the flask, you will notice that boiling stops. More heat would be required to raise the temperature (depending on the increase in pressure) before boiling begins again. Thus boiling point increases with increase in pressure. Let us now remove the burner. Allow water to cool to about 80 \u00b0C. Remove the thermometer and steam outlet. Close the flask with the airtight cork. Keep the flask turned upside down on the stand. Pour ice-cold water on the flask. Water vapours in the flask condense reducing the pressure on the water surface inside the flask. Water begins to boil again, now at a lower temperature. Thus boiling point decreases with decrease in pressure. This explains why cooking is difficult on hills. At high altitudes, atmospheric pressure is lower, reducing the boiling point of water as compared to that at sea level. On the other hand, boiling point is increased inside a pressure cooker by increasing the pressure. Hence cooking is faster. The boiling point of a substance at standard atmospheric pressure is called its normal boiling point. However, all substances do not pass through the three states: solid-liquid-gas. There are certain substances which normally pass from the solid to the vapour state directly and vice versa. The change from solid state to vapour state without passing through the liquid state is called sublimation, and the substance is said to sublime. Dry ice (solid CO2) sublimes, so also iodine."}

The amount of heat per unit mass transferred during change of state of the substance is called latent heat of the substance for the process. For example, if heat is added to a given quantity of ice at \u201310 \u00b0C, the temperature of ice increases until it reaches its melting point (0 \u00b0C). At this temperature, the addition of more heat does not increase the temperature but causes the ice to melt, or changes its state. Once the entire ice melts, adding more heat will cause the temperature of the water to rise. A similar situation occurs during liquid gas change of state at the boiling point. Adding more heat to boiling water causes vaporisation, without increase in temperature. Reprint 2025-26 THERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER 213 \u22b3 The heat required during a change of state depends upon the heat of transformation and the mass of the substance undergoing a change of state. Thus, if mass m of a substance undergoes a change from one state to the other, then the quantity of heat required is given by Q = m L or L = Q/m (10.13) where L is known as latent heat and is a characteristic of the substance. Its SI unit is J kg\u20131. The value of L also depends on the pressure. Its value is usually quoted at standard atmospheric pressure."}

The latent heats of some substances, their freezing and boiling points, are given in Table 10.5. Fig. 10.12 Temperature versus heat for water at 1 atm pressure (not to scale). Note that when heat is added (or removed) during a change of state, the temperature remains constant. Note in Fig. 10.12 that the slopes of the phase lines are not all the same, which indicate that specific heats of the various states are not equal.

Suppose, one end of a metallic rod is put in a flame, the other end of the rod will soon be so hot that you cannot hold it by your bare hands. Here, heat transfer takes place by conduction from the hot end of the rod through its different parts to the other end. Gases are poor thermal conductors, while liquids have conductivities intermediate between solids and gases. Heat conduction may be described quantitatively as the time rate of heat flow in a material for a given temperature difference. Consider a metallic bar of length L and uniform cross-section A with its two ends maintained at different temperatures. This can be done, for example, by putting the ends in thermal contact with large reservoirs at temperatures, say, TC and TD, respectively (Fig. 10.14). Let us assume the ideal condition that the sides of the bar are fully insulated so that no heat is exchanged between the sides and the surroundings.

The greater the value of K for a material, the more rapidly will it conduct heat. The SI unit of K is J s\u20131 m \u20131 K\u20131 or W m \u20131 K\u20131. The thermal conductivities of various substances are listed in Table 10.6. These values vary slightly with temperature, but can be considered to be constant over a normal temperature range. Compare the relatively large thermal conductivities of good thermal conductors and, metals, with the relatively small thermal conductivities of some good thermal insulators, such as wood and glass wool. You may have noticed that some cooking pots have copper coating on the bottom. Being a good conductor of heat, copper promotes the distribution of heat over the bottom of a pot for uniform cooking. Plastic foams, on the other hand, are good insulators, mainly because they contain pockets of air. Recall that gases are poor conductors, and note the low thermal conductivity of air in the Table 10.5. Heat retention and transfer are important in many other applications. Houses made of concrete roofs get very hot during summer days because thermal conductivity of concrete (though much smaller than that of a metal) is still not small enough."}

When a fluid is heated from below, the hot part expands and, therefore, becomes less dense. Because of buoyancy, it rises and the upper colder part replaces it. This again gets heated, rises up and is replaced by the relatively colder part of the fluid. The process goes on. This mode of heat transfer is evidently different from conduction. Convection involves bulk transport of different parts of the fluid. In forced convection, material is forced to move by a pump or by some other physical means. The common examples of forced convection systems are forced-air heating systems in home, the human circulatory system, and the cooling system of an automobile engine. In the human body, the heart acts as the pump that circulates blood through different parts of the body, transferring heat by forced convection and maintaining it at a uniform temperature. Natural convection is responsible for many familiar phenomena. During the day, the ground heats up more quickly than large bodies of water do. This occurs both because water has a greater specific heat capacity and because mixing currents disperse the absorbed heat throughout the great volume of water. The air in contact with the warm ground is heated by conduction. It expands, becoming less dense than the surrounding cooler air. As a result, the warm air rises (air currents) and the other air moves (winds) to fill the space-creating a sea breeze near a large body of water. Cooler air descends, and a thermal convection cycle is set up, which transfers heat away from the land. At night, the ground loses its heat more quickly, and the water surface is warmer than the land."}

The other example of natural convection is the steady surface wind on the earth blowing in from north-east towards the equator, the so-called trade wind. A resonable explanation is as follows: the equatorial and polar regions of the earth receive unequal solar heat. Air at the earth\u2019s surface near the equator is hot, while the air in the upper atmosphere of the poles is cool. In the absence of any other factor, a convection current would be set up, with the air at the equatorial surface rising and moving out towards the poles, descending and streaming in towards the equator. The rotation of the earth, however, modifies this convection current. Because of this, air close to the equator has an eastward speed of 1600 km/h, while it is zero close to the poles. As a result, the air descends not at the poles but at 30\u00b0 N (North) latitude and returns to the equator. This is called trade wind. Fig. 10.17 Convection cycles. Reprint 2025-26 218 PHYSICS 10.9.3 Radiation Conduction and convection require some material as a transport medium. These modes of heat transfer cannot operate between bodies separated by a distance in vacuum. But the earth does receive heat from the Sun across a huge distance. Similarly, we quickly feel the warmth of the fire nearby even though air conducts poorly and before convection takes some time to set in. The third mechanism for heat transfer needs no medium; it is called radiation and the energy so transferred by electromagnetic waves is called radiant energy. In an electromagnetic wave, electric and magnetic fields oscillate in space and time."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 96, "content": "Like any wave, electromagnetic waves can have different wavelengths and can travel in vacuum with the same speed, namely the speed of light i.e., 3 \u00d7 108 m s\u20131 . You will learn these matters in more detail later, but you now know why heat transfer by radiation does not need any medium and why it is so fast. This is how heat is transferred to the earth from the Sun through empty space. All bodies emit radiant energy, whether they are solid, liquid or gas. The electromagnetic radiation emitted by a body by virtue of its temperature, like radiation by a red hot iron or light from a filament lamp is called thermal radiation. When this thermal radiation falls on other bodies, it is partly reflected and partly absorbed. The amount of heat that a body can absorb by radiation depends on the colour of the body. We find that black bodies absorb and emit radiant energy better than bodies of lighter colours. This fact finds many applications in our daily life. We wear white or light coloured clothes in summer, so that they absorb the least heat from the Sun. However, during winter, we use dark coloured clothes, which absorb heat from the sun and keep our body warm. The bottoms of utensils for cooking food are blackened so that they absorb maximum heat from fire and transfer it to the vegetables to be cooked. Similarly, a Dewar flask or thermos bottle is a device to minimise heat transfer between the contents of the bottle and outside. It consists of a double-walled glass vessel with the inner and outer walls coated with silver. Radiation from the inner wall is reflected back to the contents of the bottle. The outer wall similarly reflects back any incoming radiation."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 97, "content": "The space between the walls is evacuted to reduce conduction and convection losses and the flask is supported on an insulator, like cork. The device is, therefore, useful for preventing hot contents (like, milk) from getting cold, or alternatively, to store cold contents (like, ice). 10.9.4 Blackbody Radiation We have so far not mentioned the wavelength content of thermal radiation. The important thing about thermal radiation at any temperature is that it is not of one (or a few) wavelength(s) but has a continuous spectrum from the small to the long wavelengths. The energy content of radiation, however, varies for different wavelengths. Figure 10.18 gives the experimental curves for radiation energy per unit area per unit wavelength emitted by a blackbody versus wavelength for different temperatures. Fig. 10.18: Energy emitted versus wavelength for a blackbody at different temperatures Notice that the wavelength \u03bbm for which energy is the maximum decreases with increasing temperature. The relation between \u03bbm and T is given by what is known as Wien\u2019s Displacement Law: \u03bbm T = constant (10.15) The value of the constant (Wien\u2019s constant) is 2.9 \u00d7 10\u20133 m K. This law explains why the colour of a piece of iron heated in a hot flame first becomes dull red, then reddish yellow, and finally white hot. Wien\u2019s law is useful for estimating the surface temperatures of celestial Reprint 2025-26 THERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER 219 bodies like, the moon, Sun and other stars. Light from the moon is found to have a maximum intensity near the wavelength 14 \u00b5m. By Wien\u2019s law, the surface of the moon is estimated to have a temperature of 200 K. Solar radiation has a maximum at \u03bbm = 4753 \u00c5."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 98, "content": "This corresponds to T = 6060 K. Remember, this is the temperature of the surface of the sun, not its interior. The most significant feature of the blackbody radiation curves in Fig. 10.18 is that they are universal. They depend only on the temperature and not on the size, shape or material of the blackbody. Attempts to explain blackbody radiation theoretically, at the beginning of the twentieth century, spurred the quantum revolution in physics, as you will learn in later courses. Energy can be transferred by radiation over large distances, without a medium (i.e., in vacuum). The total electromagnetic energy radiated by a body at absolute temperature T is proportional to its size, its ability to radiate (called emissivity) and most importantly to its temperature. For a body, which is a perfect radiator, the energy emitted per unit time (H) is given by H = A\u03c3T 4 (10.16) where A is the area and T is the absolute temperature of the body. This relation obtained experimentally by Stefan and later proved theoretically by Boltzmann is known as Stefan- Boltzmann law and the constant \u03c3 is called Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Its value in SI units is 5.67 \u00d7 10\u20138 W m\u20132 K\u20134. Most bodies emit only a fraction of the rate given by Eq. 10.16. A substance like lamp black comes close to the limit. One, therefore, defines a dimensionless fraction e called emissivity and writes, H = Ae\u03c3T 4 (10.17) Here, e = 1 for a perfect radiator. For a tungsten lamp, for example, e is about 0.4."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 99, "content": "Thus, a tungsten lamp at a temperature of 3000 K and a surface area of 0.3 cm2 radiates at the rate H = 0.3 \u00d7 10\u20134 \u00d7 0.4 \u00d7 5.67 \u00d7 10\u20138 \u00d7 (3000)4 = 60 W. A body at temperature T, with surroundings at temperatures Ts, emits, as well as, receives energy. For a perfect radiator, the net rate of loss of radiant energy is H = \u03c3A (T 4 \u2013 Ts 4) For a body with emissivity e, the relation modifies to H = e\u03c3 A (T4 \u2013 Ts 4) (10.18) As an example, let us estimate the heat radiated by our bodies. Suppose the surface area of a person\u2019s body is about 1.9 m2 and the room temperature is 22 \u00b0C. The internal body temperature, as we know, is about 37 \u00b0\u00b0C. The skin temperature may be 28\u00b0\u00b0C (say). The emissivity of the skin is about 0.97 for the relevant region of electromagnetic radiation. The rate of heat loss is: H = 5.67 \u00d7 10\u20138 \u00d7 1.9 \u00d7 0.97 \u00d7 {(301)4 \u2013 (295)4} = 66.4 W which is more than half the rate of energy production by the body at rest (120 W). To prevent this heat loss effectively (better than ordinary clothing), modern arctic clothing has an additional thin shiny metallic layer next to the skin, which reflects the body\u2019s radiation. 10.10 NEWTON\u2019S LAW OF COOLING We all know that hot water or milk when left on a table begins to cool, gradually. Ultimately it attains the temperature of the surroundings. To study how slow or fast a given body can cool on exchanging heat with its surroundings, let us perform the following activity. Take some water, say 300 mL, in a calorimeter with a stirrer and cover it with a two-holed lid."}

Then, stop heating the water by removing the heat source. Start the stop-watch and note the reading of the thermometer after a fixed interval of time, say after every one minute of stirring gently with the stirrer. Continue to note the temperature (T2) of water till it attains a temperature about 5 \u00b0C above that of the surroundings. Then, plot Reprint 2025-26 220 PHYSICS a graph by taking each value of temperature \u2206T = T2 \u2013 T1 along y-axis and the coresponding value of t along x-axis (Fig. 10.19). Fig. 10.19 Curve showing cooling of hot water with time. From the graph you can infer how the cooling of hot water depends on the difference of its temperature from that of the surroundings. You will also notice that initially the rate of cooling is higher and decreases as the temperature of the body falls. The above activity shows that a hot body loses heat to its surroundings in the form of heat radiation. The rate of loss of heat depends on the difference in temperature between the body and its surroundings. Newton was the first to study, in a systematic manner, the relation between the heat lost by a body in a given enclosure and its temperature."}

The law holds good only for small difference of temperature. Also, the loss of heat by radiation depends upon the nature of the surface of the body and the area of the exposed surface. We can write \u2013 (10.19) where k is a positive constant depending upon the area and nature of the surface of the body. Suppose a body of mass m and specific heat capacity s is at temperature T2.

We shall study the processes where work is converted into heat and vice versa. In winter, when we rub our palms together, we feel warmer; here work done in rubbing produces the \u2018heat\u2019. Conversely, in a steam engine, the \u2018heat\u2019 of the steam is used to do useful work in moving the pistons, which in turn rotate the wheels of the train. In physics, we need to define the notions of heat, temperature, work, etc. more carefully. Historically, it took a long time to arrive at the proper concept of \u2018heat\u2019. Before the modern picture, heat was regarded as a fine invisible fluid filling in the pores of a substance."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 112, "content": "On contact between a hot body and a cold body, the fluid (called caloric) flowed from the colder to the hotter body ! This is similar to what happens when a horizontal pipe connects two tanks containing water up to different heights. The flow continues until the levels of water in the two tanks are the same. Likewise, in the \u2018caloric\u2019 picture of heat, heat flows until the \u2018caloric levels\u2019 (i.e., the temperatures) equalise. In time, the picture of heat as a fluid was discarded in favour of the modern concept of heat as a form of energy. An important experiment in this connection was due to Benjamin Thomson (also known as Count Rumford) in 1798. He observed that boring of a brass cannon generated a lot of heat, indeed enough to boil water. More significantly, the amount of heat produced depended on the work done (by the horses employed for turning the drill) but not on the sharpness of the drill. In the caloric picture, a sharper drill would scoop out more heat fluid from the pores; but this was not observed. A most natural explanation of the observations was that heat was a form of energy and the experiment demonstrated conversion of energy from one form to another\u2013from work to heat. 11.1 Introduction 11.2 Thermal equilibrium 11.3 Zeroth law of Thermodynamics 11.4 Heat, internal energy and work 11.5 First law of thermodynamics 11.6 Specific heat capacity 11.7 Thermodynamic state variables and equation of state 11.8 Thermodynamic processes 11.9 Second law of thermodynamics 11.10 Reversible and irreversible processes 11.11 Carnot engine Summary Points to ponder Exercises Reprint 2025-26 THERMODYNAMICS 227 Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the concepts of heat and temperature and the inter-conversion of heat and other forms of energy."}

In fact, its concepts and laws were formulated in the nineteenth century before the molecular picture of matter was firmly established. Thermodynamic description involves relatively few macroscopic variables of the system, which are suggested by common sense and can be usually measured directly. A microscopic description of a gas, for example, would involve specifying the co-ordinates and velocities of the huge number of molecules constituting the gas. The description in kinetic theory of gases is not so detailed but it does involve molecular distribution of velocities. Thermodynamic description of a gas, on the other hand, avoids the molecular description altogether. Instead, the state of a gas in thermodynamics is specified by macroscopic variables such as pressure, volume, temperature, mass and composition that are felt by our sense perceptions and are measurable*. The distinction between mechanics and thermodynamics is worth bearing in mind. In mechanics, our interest is in the motion of particles or bodies under the action of forces and torques. Thermodynamics is not concerned with the motion of the system as a whole. It is concerned with the internal macroscopic state of the body. When a bullet is fired from a gun, what changes is the mechanical state of the bullet (its kinetic energy, in particular), not its temperature. When the bullet pierces a wood and stops, the kinetic energy of the bullet gets converted into heat, changing the temperature of the bullet and the surrounding layers of wood. Temperature is related to the energy of the internal (disordered) motion of the bullet, not to the motion of the bullet as a whole."}

The term \u2018equilibrium\u2019 in thermodynamics appears in a different context : we say the state of a system is an equilibrium state if the macroscopic variables that characterise the system do not change in time. For example, a gas inside a closed rigid container, completely insulated from its surroundings, with fixed values of pressure, volume, temperature, mass and composition that do not change with time, is in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium.

In this case, it is found that any possible pair of values (PA, VA) will be in equilibrium with any possible pair of values (PB, VB). Next, suppose that the adiabatic wall is replaced by a diathermic wall \u2013 a conducting wall that allows energy flow (heat) from one to another. It is then found that the macroscopic variables of the systems A and B change spontaneously until both the systems attain equilibrium states. After that there is no change in their states.

There is no more energy flow from one to another. We then say that the system A is in thermal equilibrium with the system B. What characterises the situation of thermal equilibrium between two systems ? You can guess the answer from your experience. In thermal equilibrium, the temperatures of the two systems are equal. We shall see how does one arrive at the concept of temperature in thermodynamics? The Zeroth law of thermodynamics provides the clue. 11.3 ZEROTH LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS Imagine two systems A and B, separated by an adiabatic wall, while each is in contact with a third system C, via a conducting wall [Fig. 11.2(a)]."}

After this is achieved, suppose that the adiabatic wall between A and B is replaced by a conducting wall and C is insulated from A and B by an adiabatic wall [Fig.11.2(b)]. It is found that the states of A and B change no further i.e. they are found to be in thermal equilibrium with each other. This observation forms the basis of the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics, which states that \u2018two systems in thermal equilibrium with a third system separately are in thermal equilibrium with each other\u2019. R.H. Fowler formulated this law in 1931 long after the first and second Laws of thermodynamics were stated and so numbered. The Zeroth Law clearly suggests that when two systems A and B, are in thermal equilibrium, there must be a physical quantity that has the same value for both. This thermodynamic variable whose value is equal for two systems in thermal equilibrium is called temperature (T ). Thus, if A and B are separately in equilibrium with C, TA = TC and TB = TC. This implies that TA = TB i.e. the systems A and B are also in thermal equilibrium. We have arrived at the concept of temperature formally via the Zeroth Law. The next question is : how to assign numerical values to temperatures of different bodies ? In other words, how do we construct a scale of temperature ? Thermometry deals with this basic question to which we turn in the next section.

(a) (b) Reprint 2025-26 THERMODYNAMICS 229 11.4 HEAT, INTERNAL ENERGY AND WORK The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics led us to the concept of temperature that agrees with our commonsense notion. Temperature is a marker of the \u2018hotness\u2019 of a body. It determines the direction of flow of heat when two bodies are placed in thermal contact. Heat flows from the body at a higher temperature to the one at lower temperature. The flow stops when the temperatures equalise; the two bodies are then in thermal equilibrium. We saw in some detail how to construct temperature scales to assign temperatures to different bodies. We now describe the concepts of heat and other relevant quantities like internal energy and work. The concept of internal energy of a system is not difficult to understand. We know that every bulk system consists of a large number of molecules. Internal energy is simply the sum of the kinetic energies and potential energies of these molecules. We remarked earlier that in thermodynamics, the kinetic energy of the system, as a whole, is not relevant. Internal energy is thus, the sum of molecular kinetic and potential energies in the frame of reference relative to which the centre of mass of the system is at rest. Thus, it includes only the (disordered) energy associated with the random motion of molecules of the system. We denote the internal energy of a system by U."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 118, "content": "Though we have invoked the molecular picture to understand the meaning of internal energy, as far as thermodynamics is concerned, U is simply a macroscopic variable of the system. The important thing about internal energy is that it depends only on the state of the system, not on how that state was achieved. Internal energy U of a system is an example of a thermodynamic \u2018state variable\u2019 \u2013 its value depends only on the given state of the system, not on history i.e. not on the \u2018path\u2019 taken to arrive at that state. Thus, the internal energy of a given mass of gas depends on its state described by specific values of pressure, volume and temperature. It does not depend on how this state of the gas came about. Pressure, volume, temperature, and internal energy are thermodynamic state variables of the system (gas) (see section 11.7). If we neglect the small intermolecular forces in a gas, the internal energy of a gas is just the sum of kinetic energies associated with various random motions of its molecules. We will see in the next chapter that in a gas this motion is not only translational (i.e. motion from one point to another in the volume of the container); it also includes rotational and vibrational motion of the molecules (Fig. 11.3). Fig. 11.3 (a) Internal energy U of a gas is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of its molecules when the box is at rest.

(a) Heat is energy transfer due to temperature difference between the system and the surroundings. (b) Work is energy transfer brought about by means (e.g. moving the piston by raising or lowering some weight connected to it) that do not involve such a temperature difference. Reprint 2025-26 PHYSICS 230 What are the ways of changing internal energy of a system ? Consider again, for simplicity, the system to be a certain mass of gas contained in a cylinder with a movable piston as shown in Fig. 11.4. Experience shows there are two ways of changing the state of the gas (and hence its internal energy). One way is to put the cylinder in contact with a body at a higher temperature than that of the gas. The temperature difference will cause a flow of energy (heat) from the hotter body to the gas, thus increasing the internal energy of the gas. The other way is to push the piston down i.e. to do work on the system, which again results in increasing the internal energy of the gas. Of course, both these things could happen in the reverse direction. With surroundings at a lower temperature, heat would flow from the gas to the surroundings. Likewise, the gas could push the piston up and do work on the surroundings. In short, heat and work are two different modes of altering the state of a thermodynamic system and changing its internal energy. The notion of heat should be carefully distinguished from the notion of internal energy. Heat is certainly energy, but it is the energy in transit. This is not just a play of words."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 120, "content": "The distinction is of basic significance. The state of a thermodynamic system is characterised by its internal energy, not heat. A statement like \u2018a gas in a given state has a certain amount of heat\u2019 is as meaningless as the statement that \u2018a gas in a given state has a certain amount of work\u2019. In contrast, \u2018a gas in a given state has a certain amount of internal energy\u2019 is a perfectly meaningful statement. Similarly, the statements \u2018a certain amount of heat is supplied to the system\u2019 or \u2018a certain amount of work was done by the system\u2019 are perfectly meaningful. To summarise, heat and work in thermodynamics are not state variables. They are modes of energy transfer to a system resulting in change in its internal energy, which, as already mentioned, is a state variable. In ordinary language, we often confuse heat with internal energy. The distinction between them is sometimes ignored in elementary physics books. For proper understanding of thermodynamics, however, the distinction is crucial. 11.5 FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS We have seen that the internal energy U of a system can change through two modes of energy transfer : heat and work. Let \u2206Q = Heat supplied to the system by the surroundings \u2206W = Work done by the system on the surroundings \u2206U = Change in internal energy of the system The general principle of conservation of energy then implies that \u2206Q = \u2206U + \u2206W (11.1) i.e. the energy (\u2206Q) supplied to the system goes in partly to increase the internal energy of the system (\u2206U) and the rest in work on the environment (\u2206W). Equation (11.1) is known as the First Law of Thermodynamics."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 121, "content": "It is simply the general law of conservation of energy applied to any system in which the energy transfer from or to the surroundings is taken into account. Let us put Eq. (11.1) in the alternative form \u2206Q \u2013 \u2206W = \u2206U (11.2) Now, the system may go from an initial state to the final state in a number of ways. For example, to change the state of a gas from (P1, V1) to (P2, V2), we can first change the volume of the gas from V1 to V2, keeping its pressure constant i.e. we can first go the state (P1, V2) and then change the pressure of the gas from P1 to P2, keeping volume constant, to take the gas to (P2, V2). Alternatively, we can first keep the volume constant and then keep the pressure constant. Since U is a state variable, \u2206U depends only on the initial and final states and not on the path taken by the gas to go from one to the other. However, \u2206Q and \u2206W will, in general, depend on the path taken to go from the initial to final states. From the First Law of Thermodynamics, Eq. (11.2), it is clear that the combination \u2206Q \u2013 \u2206W, is however, path independent. This shows that if a system is taken through a process in which \u2206U = 0 (for example, isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, see section 11.8), \u2206Q = \u2206W i.e., heat supplied to the system is used up entirely by the system in doing work on the environment.

(11.3), consider the change in internal energy for 1 g of water when we go from its liquid to vapour phase. The measured latent heat of water is 2256 J/g. i.e., for 1 g of water \u2206Q = 2256 J. At atmospheric pressure, 1 g of water has a volume 1 cm3 in liquid phase and 1671 cm3 in vapour phase.

We will see in Chapter 12 that predictions of specific heats of gases generally agree with experiment.

One calorie was earlier defined to be the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1g of water by 1\u00b0C. With more precise measurements, it was found that the specific heat of water varies slightly with temperature. Figure 11.5 shows this variation in the temperature range 0 to 100 \u00b0C. Fig. 11.5 Variation of specific heat capacity of water with temperature. For a precise definition of calorie, it was, therefore, necessary to specify the unit temperature interval. One calorie is defined to be the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1g of water from 14.5 \u00b0C to 15.5 \u00b0C. Since heat is just a form of energy, it is preferable to use the unit joule, J. In SI units, the specific heat capacity of water is 4186 J kg\u20131 K\u20131 i.e. 4.186 J g\u20131 K\u20131."}

For example, an equilibrium state of a gas is completely specified by the values of pressure, volume, temperature, and mass (and composition if there is a mixture of gases). A thermodynamic system is not always in equilibrium. For example, a gas allowed to expand freely against vacuum is not an equilibrium state [Fig. 11.6(a)]. During the rapid expansion, pressure of the gas may Reprint 2025-26 THERMODYNAMICS 233 not be uniform throughout. Similarly, a mixture of gases undergoing an explosive chemical reaction (e.g. a mixture of petrol vapour and air when ignited by a spark) is not an equilibrium state; again its temperature and pressure are not uniform [Fig. 11.6(b)]. Eventually, the gas attains a uniform temperature and pressure and comes to thermal and mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings.

{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 127, "content": "In both situations, the gas is not in equilibrium and cannot be described by state variables. In short, thermodynamic state variables describe equilibrium states of systems. The various state variables are not necessarily independent. The connection between the state variables is called the equation of state. For example, for an ideal gas, the equation of state is the ideal gas relation P V = \u00b5 R T For a fixed amount of the gas i.e. given \u00b5, there are thus, only two independent variables, say P and V or T and V. The pressure-volume curve for a fixed temperature is called an isotherm. Real gases may have more complicated equations of state. The thermodynamic state variables are of two kinds: extensive and intensive. Extensive variables indicate the \u2018size\u2019 of the system. Intensive variables such as pressure and temperature do not. To decide which variable is extensive and which intensive, think of a relevant system in equilibrium, and imagine that it is divided into two equal parts. The variables that remain unchanged for each part are intensive. The variables whose values get halved in each part are extensive. It is easily seen, for example, that internal energy U, volume V, total mass M are extensive variables. Pressure P, temperature T, and density \u03c1 are intensive variables. It is a good practice to check the consistency of thermodynamic equations using this classification of variables. For example, in the equation \u2206Q = \u2206U + P \u2206V quantities on both sides are extensive*.

During the process, the gas passes through states that are not equilibrium states. The non- equilibrium states do not have well-defined pressure and temperature. In the same way, if a finite temperature difference exists between the gas and its surroundings, there will be a rapid exchange of heat during which the gas will pass through non-equilibrium states. In due course, the gas will settle to an equilibrium state with well-defined temperature and pressure equal to those of the surroundings. The free expansion of a gas in vacuum and a mixture of gases undergoing an explosive chemical reaction, mentioned in section 11.7 are also examples where the system goes through non- equilibrium states.

In practice, processes that are sufficiently slow and do not involve accelerated motion of the piston, large temperature gradient, etc., are reasonably approximation to an ideal quasi-static process. We shall from now on deal with quasi-static processes only, except when stated otherwise. A process in which the temperature of the system is kept fixed throughout is called an isothermal process. The expansion of a gas in a metallic cylinder placed in a large reservoir of fixed temperature is an example of an isothermal process. (Heat transferred from the reservoir to the system does not materially affect the temperature of the reservoir, because of its very large heat capacity.) In isobaric processes the pressure is constant while in isochoric processes the volume is constant.

Common experience shows that there are many conceivable processes that are perfectly allowed by the First Law and yet are never observed. For example, nobody has ever seen a book lying on a table jumping to a height by itself. But such a thing would be possible if the principle of conservation of energy were the only restriction. The table could cool spontaneously, converting some of its internal energy into an equal amount of mechanical energy of the book, which would then hop to a height with potential energy equal to the mechanical energy it acquired. But this never happens."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 133, "content": "Clearly, some additional basic principle of nature forbids the above, even though it satisfies the energy conservation principle. This principle, which disallows many phenomena consistent with the First Law of Thermodynamics is known as the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law of Thermodynamics gives a fundamental limitation to the efficiency of a heat engine and the co-efficient of performance of a refrigerator. In simple terms, it says that efficiency of a heat engine can never be unity. For a refrigerator, the Second Law says that the co-efficient of performance can never be infinite. The following two statements, one due to Kelvin and Planck denying the possibility of a perfect heat engine, and another due to Clausius denying the possibility of a perfect refrigerator or heat pump, are a concise summary of these observations. Kelvin-Planck statement No process is possible whose sole result is the absorption of heat from a reservoir and the complete conversion of the heat into work. Clausius statement No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a colder object to a hotter object. It can be proved that the two statements above are completely equivalent. 11.10 REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE PROCESSES Imagine some process in which a thermodynamic system goes from an initial state i to a final state f. During the process the system absorbs heat Q from the surroundings and performs work W on it. Can we reverse this process and bring both the system and surroundings to their initial states with no other effect anywhere ? Experience suggests that for most processes in nature this is not possible. The spontaneous processes of nature are irreversible. Several examples can be cited. The base of a vessel on an oven is hotter than its other parts."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 134, "content": "When the vessel is removed, heat is transferred from the base to the other parts, bringing the vessel to a uniform temperature (which in due course cools to the temperature of the surroundings). The process cannot be reversed; a part of the vessel will not get cooler spontaneously and warm up the base. It will violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics, if it did. The free expansion of a gas is irreversible. The combustion reaction of a mixture of petrol and air ignited by a spark cannot be reversed. Cooking gas leaking from a gas cylinder in the kitchen diffuses to the entire room. The diffusion process will not spontaneously reverse and bring the gas back to the cylinder. The stirring of a liquid in thermal contact with a reservoir will convert the work done into heat, increasing the internal energy of the reservoir. The process cannot be reversed exactly; otherwise it would amount to conversion of heat entirely into work, violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Irreversibility is a rule rather an exception in nature. Irreversibility arises mainly from two causes: one, many processes (like a free expansion, or an explosive chemical reaction) take the system to non-equilibrium states; two, most processes involve friction, viscosity and other dissipative effects (e.g., a moving body coming to a stop and losing its mechanical energy as heat to the floor and the body; a rotating blade in a liquid coming to a stop due to viscosity and losing its mechanical energy with corresponding gain in the internal energy of the liquid). Since dissipative effects are present everywhere and can be minimised but not fully eliminated, most processes that we deal with are irreversible."}

From the preceding discussion, a reversible process is an idealised notion. A process is reversible only if it is quasi-static (system in equilibrium with the surroundings at every stage) and there are no dissipative effects. For example, a quasi-static isothermal expansion of an ideal gas in a cylinder fitted with a frictionless movable piston is a reversible process. Why is reversibility such a basic concept in thermodynamics ? As we have seen, one of the concerns of thermodynamics is the efficiency with which heat can be converted into work. The Second Law of Thermodynamics rules out the possibility of a perfect heat engine with 100% efficiency. But what is the highest efficiency possible for a heat engine working between two reservoirs at temperatures T1 and T2? It turns out that a heat engine based on idealised reversible processes achieves the highest efficiency possible. All other engines involving irreversibility in any way (as would be the case for practical engines) have lower than this limiting efficiency. 11.11 CARNOT ENGINE Suppose we have a hot reservoir at temperature T1 and a cold reservoir at temperature T2. What is the maximum efficiency possible for a heat engine operating between the two reservoirs and what cycle of processes should be adopted to achieve the maximum efficiency ? Sadi Carnot, a French engineer, first considered this question in 1824. Interestingly, Carnot arrived at the correct answer, even though the basic concepts of heat and thermodynamics had yet to be firmly established."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 136, "content": "We expect the ideal engine operating between two temperatures to be a reversible engine. Irreversibility is associated with dissipative effects, as remarked in the preceding section, and lowers efficiency. A process is reversible if it is quasi-static and non-dissipative. We have seen that a process is not quasi-static if it involves finite temperature difference between the system and the reservoir. This implies that in a reversible heat engine operating between two temperatures, heat should be absorbed (from the hot reservoir) isothermally and released (to the cold reservoir) isothermally. We thus have identified two steps of the reversible heat engine : isothermal process at temperature T1 absorbing heat Q1 from the hot reservoir, and another isothermal process at temperature T2 releasing heat Q2 to the cold reservoir. To complete a cycle, we need to take the system from temperature T1 to T2 and then back from temperature T2 to T1. Which processes should we employ for this purpose that are reversible? A little reflection shows that we can only adopt reversible adiabatic processes for these purposes, which involve no heat flow from any reservoir. If we employ any other process that is not adiabatic, say an isochoric process, to take the system from one temperature to another, we shall need a series of reservoirs in the temperature range T2 to T1 to ensure that at each stage the process is quasi-static. (Remember again that for a process to be quasi-static and reversible, there should be no finite temperature difference between the system and the reservoir.) But we are considering a reversible engine that operates between only two temperatures. Thus adiabatic processes must bring about the temperature change in the system from T1 to T2 and T2 to T1 in this engine. Fig."}

Boyle, Newton and several others tried to explain the behaviour of gases by considering that gases are made up of tiny atomic particles. The actual atomic theory got established more than 150 years later. Kinetic theory explains the behaviour of gases based on the idea that the gas consists of rapidly moving atoms or molecules. This is possible as the inter-atomic forces, which are short range forces that are important for solids and liquids, can be neglected for gases."}

It also relates measurable properties of gases such as viscosity, conduction and diffusion with molecular parameters, yielding estimates of molecular sizes and masses. This chapter gives an introduction to kinetic theory. 12.2 MOLECULAR NATURE OF MATTER Richard Feynman, one of the great physicists of 20th century considers the discovery that \u201cMatter is made up of atoms\u201d to be a very significant one. Humanity may suffer annihilation (due to nuclear catastrophe) or extinction (due to environmental disasters) if we do not act wisely. If that happens, and all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed then Feynman would like the \u2018Atomic Hypothesis\u2019 to be communicated to the next generation of creatures in the universe. Atomic Hypothesis: All things are made of atoms - little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.

{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 148, "content": "The first law says that any given compound has, a fixed proportion by mass of its constituents. The second law says that when two elements form more than one compound, for a fixed mass of one element, the masses of the other elements are in ratio of small integers. To explain the laws Dalton suggested, about 200 years ago, that the smallest constituents of an element are atoms. Atoms of one element are identical but differ from those of other elements. A small number of atoms of each element combine to form a molecule of the compound. Gay Lussac\u2019s law, also given in early 19th century, states: When gases combine chemically to yield another gas, their volumes are in the ratios of small integers. Avogadro\u2019s law (or hypothesis) says: Equal volumes of all gases at equal temperature and pressure have the same number of molecules. Avogadro\u2019s law, when combined with Dalton\u2019s theory explains Gay Lussac\u2019s law. Since the elements are often in the form of molecules, Dalton\u2019s atomic theory can also be referred to as the molecular theory of matter. The theory is now well accepted by scientists. However even at the end of the nineteenth century there were famous scientists who did not believe in atomic theory ! From many observations, in recent times we now know that molecules (made up of one or more atoms) constitute matter. Electron microscopes and scanning tunnelling microscopes enable us to even see them. The size of an atom is about an angstrom (10 -10 m). In solids, which are tightly packed, atoms are spaced about a few angstroms (2 \u00c5) apart. In liquids the separation between atoms is also about the same. In liquids the atoms are not as rigidly fixed as in solids, and can move around."}

The average distance a molecule can travel without colliding is called the mean free path. The mean free path, in gases, is of the order of thousands of angstroms. The atoms are much freer in gases and can travel long distances without colliding. If they are not enclosed, gases disperse away. In solids and liquids the closeness makes the interatomic force important. The force has a long range attraction and a short range repulsion. The atoms attract when they are at a few angstroms but repel when they come closer. The static appearance of a gas Atomic Hypothesis in Ancient India and Greece Though John Dalton is credited with the introduction of atomic viewpoint in modern science, scholars in ancient India and Greece conjectured long before the existence of atoms and molecules. In the Vaiseshika school of thought in India founded by Kanada (Sixth century B.C.) the atomic picture was developed in considerable detail. Atoms were thought to be eternal, indivisible, infinitesimal and ultimate parts of matter. It was argued that if matter could be subdivided without an end, there would be no difference between a mustard seed and the Meru mountain. The four kinds of atoms (Paramanu \u2014 Sanskrit word for the smallest particle) postulated were Bhoomi (Earth), Ap (water), Tejas (fire) and Vayu (air) that have characteristic mass and other attributes, were propounded. Akasa (space) was thought to have no atomic structure and was continuous and inert. Atoms combine to form different molecules (e.g. two atoms combine to form a diatomic molecule dvyanuka, three atoms form a tryanuka or a triatomic molecule), their properties depending upon the nature and ratio of the constituent atoms."}

In Lalitavistara, a famous biography of the Buddha written mainly in the second century B.C., the estimate is close to the modern estimate of atomic size, of the order of 10 \u201310 m. In ancient Greece, Democritus (Fourth century B.C.) is best known for his atomic hypothesis. The word \u2018atom\u2019 means \u2018indivisible\u2019 in Greek. According to him, atoms differ from each other physically, in shape, size and other properties and this resulted in the different properties of the substances formed by their combination. The atoms of water were smooth and round and unable to \u2018hook\u2019 on to each other, which is why liquid /water flows easily. The atoms of earth were rough and jagged, so they held together to form hard substances. The atoms of fire were thorny which is why it caused painful burns.

This is mainly because in a gas, molecules are far from each other and their mutual interactions are negligible except when two molecules collide. Gases at low pressures and high temperatures much above that at which they liquefy (or solidify) approximately satisfy a simple relation between their pressure, temperature and volume given by (see Chapter 10) PV = KT (12.1) for a given sample of the gas. Here T is the temperature in kelvin or (absolute) scale. K is a constant for the given sample but varies with the volume of the gas. If we now bring in the idea of atoms or molecules, then K is proportional to the number of molecules, (say) N in the sample. We can write K = N k .

We can derive an expression for the pressure of a gas based on the kinetic theory. We begin with the idea that molecules of a gas are in incessant random motion, colliding against one another and with the walls of the container. All collisions between molecules among themselves or between molecules and the walls are elastic. This implies that total kinetic energy is conserved. The total momentum is conserved as usual. 12.4.1 Pressure of an Ideal Gas Consider a gas enclosed in a cube of side l. Take the axes to be parallel to the sides of the cube, as shown in Fig. 12.4. A molecule with velocity (vx, vy, vz ) hits the planar wall parallel to yz- plane of area A (= l2). Since the collision is elastic, the molecule rebounds with the same velocity; its y and z components of velocity do not change in the collision but the x-component reverses sign. That is, the velocity after collision is (-vx, vy, vz ) . The change in momentum of the molecule is: \u2013mvx \u2013 (mvx) = \u2013 2mvx . By the principle of conservation of momentum, the momentum imparted to the wall in the collision = 2mvx . the wall."}

The total momentum transferred to the wall by these molecules in time \u2206t is: Q = (2mvx) (\u00bd n A vx \u2206t ) (12.10) The force on the wall is the rate of momentum transfer Q/\u2206t and pressure is force per unit area : P = Q /(A \u2206t) = n m vx 2 (12.11) Actually, all molecules in a gas do not have the same velocity; there is a distribution in velocities. The above equation, therefore, stands for pressure due to the group of molecules with speed vx in the x-direction and n stands for the number density of that group of molecules. The total pressure is obtained by summing over the contribution due to all groups: P = n m 2 x v (12.12) where 2 x v is the average of vx 2 . Now the gas is isotropic, i.e. there is no preferred direction of velocity of the molecules in the vessel.

The number of molecules hitting the wall in time \u2206t was found to be \u00bd n Avx \u2206t. Now the collisions are random and the gas is in a steady state. Thus, if a molecule with velocity (vx, vy, vz ) acquires a different velocity due to collision with some molecule, there will always be some other Fig. 12.4 Elastic collision of a gas molecule with the wall of the container. To calculate the force (and pressure) on the wall, we need to calculate momentum imparted to the wall per unit time.

If it is constrained to move in a plane it needs two; and if constrained to move along a line, it needs just one coordinate to locate it. This can also be expressed in another way. We say that it has one degree of freedom for motion in a line, two for motion in a plane and three for motion in space. Motion of a body as a whole from one point to another is called translation. Thus, a molecule free to move in space has three translational degrees of freedom. Each translational degree of freedom contributes a term that contains square of some variable of motion, e.g., \u00bd mvx 2 and similar terms in vy and vz. In, Eq. (12.24) we see that in thermal equilibrium, the average of each such term is \u00bd kBT . Molecules of a monatomic gas like argon have only translational degrees of freedom. But what about a diatomic gas such as O2 or N2? A molecule of O2 has three translational degrees of freedom. But in addition it can also rotate about its centre of mass.

The most elegant principle of classical statistical mechanics (first proved by Maxwell) states that this is so for each mode of energy: translational, rotational and vibrational. That is, in equilibrium, the total energy is equally distributed in all possible energy modes, with each mode having an average energy equal to \u00bd kBT.

This universal volume is called molar volume. Thus the cylinder in this example contains 2 mol of helium. Further, since helium is monatomic, its predicted (and observed) molar specific heat at constant volume, Cv = (3/2) R, and molar specific heat at constant pressure, Cp = (3/2) R + R = (5/2) R.

As a result, they cannot move straight unhindered; their paths keep getting incessantly deflected. Fig. 12.7 The volume swept by a molecule in time \u2206t in which any molecule will collide with it.

You have already learnt about some of them, e.g., rectilinear motion and motion of a projectile. Both these motions are non-repetitive. We have also learnt about uniform circular motion and orbital motion of planets in the solar system."}

In your childhood, you must have enjoyed rocking in a cradle or swinging on a swing. Both these motions are repetitive in nature but different from the periodic motion of a planet. Here, the object moves to and fro about a mean position. The pendulum of a wall clock executes a similar motion. Examples of such periodic to and fro motion abound: a boat tossing up and down in a river, the piston in a steam engine going back and forth, etc. Such a motion is termed as oscillatory motion. In this chapter we study this motion. The study of oscillatory motion is basic to physics; its concepts are required for the understanding of many physical phenomena. In musical instruments, like the sitar, the guitar or the violin, we come across vibrating strings that produce pleasing sounds. The membranes in drums and diaphragms in telephone and speaker systems vibrate to and fro about their mean positions. The vibrations of air molecules make the propagation of sound possible. In a solid, the atoms vibrate about their equilibrium positions, the average energy of vibrations being proportional to temperature. AC power supply give voltage that oscillates alternately going positive and negative about the mean value (zero). The description of a periodic motion, in general, and oscillatory motion, in particular, requires some fundamental concepts, like period, frequency, displacement, amplitude and phase. These concepts are developed in the next section."}

Suppose an insect climbs up a ramp and falls down, it comes back to the initial point and repeats the process identically. If you draw a graph of its height above the ground versus time, it would look something like Fig. 13.1 (a). If a child climbs up a step, comes down, and repeats the process identically, its height above the ground would look like that in Fig. 13.1 (b). When you play the game of bouncing a ball off the ground, between your palm and the ground, its height versus time graph would look like the one in Fig. 13.1 (c). Note that both the curved parts in Fig. 13.1 (c) are sections of a parabola given by the Newton\u2019s equation of motion (see section 2.6), 2 1 2 + gt h = ut for downward motion, and 2 1 2 \u2013 gt h = ut for upward motion, with different values of u in each case. These are examples of periodic motion. Thus, a motion that repeats itself at regular intervals of time is called periodic motion. Fig. 13.1 Examples of periodic motion. The period T is shown in each case. Very often, the body undergoing periodic motion has an equilibrium position somewhere inside its path. When the body is at this position no net external force acts on it. Therefore, if it is left there at rest, it remains there forever."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 180, "content": "If the body is given a small displacement from the position, a force comes into play which tries to bring the body back to the equilibrium point, giving rise to oscillations or vibrations. For example, a ball placed in a bowl will be in equilibrium at the bottom. If displaced a little from the point, it will perform oscillations in the bowl. Every oscillatory motion is periodic, but every periodic motion need not be oscillatory. Circular motion is a periodic motion, but it is not oscillatory. There is no significant difference between oscillations and vibrations. It seems that when the frequency is small, we call it oscillation (like, the oscillation of a branch of a tree), while when the frequency is high, we call it vibration (like, the vibration of a string of a musical instrument). Simple harmonic motion is the simplest form of oscillatory motion. This motion arises when the force on the oscillating body is directly proportional to its displacement from the mean position, which is also the equilibrium position. Further, at any point in its oscillation, this force is directed towards the mean position. In practice, oscillating bodies eventually come to rest at their equilibrium positions because of the damping due to friction and other dissipative causes. However, they can be forced to remain oscillating by means of some external periodic agency. We discuss the phenomena of damped and forced oscillations later in the chapter. Any material medium can be pictured as a collection of a large number of coupled oscillators. The collective oscillations of the constituents of a medium manifest themselves as waves. Examples of waves include water waves, seismic waves, electromagnetic waves. We shall study the wave phenomenon in the next chapter."}

The smallest interval of time after which the motion is repeated is called its period. Let us denote the period by the symbol T. Its SI unit is second. For periodic motions, (a) (b) (c) Reprint 2025-26 OSCILLATIONS 261 which are either too fast or too slow on the scale of seconds, other convenient units of time are used. The period of vibrations of a quartz crystal is expressed in units of microseconds (10\u20136 s) abbreviated as \u00b5s. On the other hand, the orbital period of the planet Mercury is 88 earth days. The Halley\u2019s comet appears after every 76 years. The reciprocal of T gives the number of repetitions that occur per unit time. This quantity is called the frequency of the periodic motion. It is represented by the symbol \u03bd. The relation between \u03bd and T is \u03bd = 1/T (13.1) The unit of \u03bd is thus s\u20131. After the discoverer of radio waves, Heinrich Rudolph Hertz (1857\u20131894), a special name has been given to the unit of frequency. It is called hertz (abbreviated as Hz). Thus, 1 hertz = 1 Hz =1 oscillation per second =1 s\u20131 (13.2) Note, that the frequency, \u03bd, is not necessarily an integer. u Example 13.1 On an average, a human heart is found to beat 75 times in a minute. Calculate its frequency and period. Answer The beat frequency of heart = 75/(1 min) = 75/(60 s) = 1.25 s\u20131 = 1.25 Hz The time period T = 1/(1.25 s\u20131) = 0.8 s \u22b3 13.2.2 Displacement In section 3.2, we defined displacement of a particle as the change in its position vector."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 182, "content": "In this chapter, we use the term displacement in a more general sense. It refers to change with time of any physical property under consideration. For example, in case of rectilinear motion of a steel ball on a surface, the distance from the starting point as a function of time is its position displacement. The choice of origin is a matter of convenience. Consider a block attached to a spring, the other end of the spring is fixed to a rigid wall [see Fig.13.2(a)]. Generally, it is convenient to measure displacement of the body from its equilibrium position. For an oscillating simple pendulum, the angle from the vertical as a function of time may be regarded as a displacement variable [see Fig.13.2(b)]. The term displacement is not always to be referred Fig. 13.2(a) A block attached to a spring, the other end of which is fixed to a rigid wall. The block moves on a frictionless surface.

There can be many other kinds of displacement variables. The voltage across a capacitor, changing with time in an AC circuit, is also a displacement variable. In the same way, pressure variations in time in the propagation of sound wave, the changing electric and magnetic fields in a light wave are examples of displacement in different contexts. The displacement variable may take both positive and negative values. In experiments on oscillations, the displacement is measured for different times. The displacement can be represented by a mathematical function of time."}

One of the simplest periodic functions is given by f (t) = A cos \u03c9t (13.3a) If the argument of this function, \u03c9t, is increased by an integral multiple of 2\u03c0 radians, the value of the function remains the same. The Reprint 2025-26 PHYSICS 262 function f (t) is then periodic and its period, T, is given by \u03c9 \u03c0 2 = T (13.3b) Thus, the function f (t) is periodic with period T, f (t) = f (t+T ) The same result is obviously correct if we consider a sine function, f (t ) = A sin \u03c9t. Further, a linear combination of sine and cosine functions like, f (t) = A sin \u03c9t + B cos \u03c9t (13.3c) is also a periodic function with the same period T.

(ii) This is an example of a periodic motion. It can be noted that each term represents a periodic function with a different angular frequency. Since period is the least interval of time after which a function repeats its value, sin \u03c9t has a period T0= 2\u03c0/\u03c9 ; cos 2 \u03c9t has a period \u03c0/\u03c9 =T0/2; and sin 4 \u03c9t has a period 2\u03c0/4\u03c9 = T0/4. The period of the first term is a multiple of the periods of the last two terms. Therefore, the smallest interval of time after which the sum of the three terms repeats is T0, and thus, the sum is a periodic function with a period 2\u03c0/\u03c9. (iii) The function e\u2013\u03c9t is not periodic, it decreases monotonically with increasing time and tends to zero as t \u2192 \u221e and thus, never repeats its value. (iv) The function log(\u03c9t) increases monotonically with time t. It, therefore, never repeats its value and is a non- periodic function. It may be noted that as t \u2192 \u221e, log(\u03c9t) diverges to \u221e. It, therefore, cannot represent any kind of physical displacement. \u22b3 13.3 SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION Consider a particle oscillating back and forth about the origin of an x-axis between the limits +A and \u2013A as shown in Fig. 13.3."}

Fig. 13.4 shows the positions of a particle executing SHM at discrete value of time, each interval of time being T/4, where T is the period of motion. Fig. 13.5 plots the graph of x versus t, which gives the values of displacement as a continuous function of time. The quantities A, Reprint 2025-26 OSCILLATIONS 263 \u03c9 and \u03c6 which characterize a given SHM have standard names, as summarised in Fig. 13.6. Let us understand these quantities. The amplitutde A of SHM is the magnitude of maximum displacement of the particle. [Note, A can be taken to be positive without any loss of generality]. As the cosine function of time varies from +1 to \u20131, the displacement varies between the extremes A and \u2013 A. Two simple harmonic motions may have same \u03c9 and \u03c6 but different amplitudes A and B, as shown in Fig. 13.7 (a). While the amplitude A is fixed for a given SHM, the state of motion (position and velocity) of the particle at any time t is determined by the Fig. 13.4 The location of the particle in SHM at the discrete values t = 0, T/4, T/2, 3T/4, T, 5T/4."}

To summarise the discussion so far, simple harmonic motion can be defined in two equivalent ways, either by Eq. (13.4) for displacement or by Eq. (13.13) that gives its force law. Going from Eq. (13.4) to Eq. (13.13) required us to differentiate two times. Likewise, by integrating the force law Eq. (13.13) two times, we can get back Eq. (13.4). Note that the force in Eq. (13.13) is linearly proportional to x(t). A particle oscillating under such a force is, therefore, calling a linear harmonic oscillator. In the real world, the force may contain small additional terms proportional to x2, x3, etc. These then are called non-linear oscillators. u Example 13.6 Two identical springs of spring constant k are attached to a block of mass m and to fixed supports as shown in Fig. 13.14.

Observe that both kinetic energy and potential energy in SHM are seen to be always positive in Fig. 13.16.

Since the motion of the bob is along a circle of length L and centre at the support point, the bob has a radial acceleration (\u03c92L) and also a tangental acceleration; the latter arises since motion along the arc of the circle is not uniform. The radial acceleration is provided by the net radial force T \u2013mg cos\u03b8, while the tangential acceleration is provided by mg sin\u03b8. It is more convenient to work with torque about the support since the radial force gives zero torque. Torque \u03c4 about the support is entirely provided by the tangental component of force \u03c4 = \u2013L (mg sin\u03b8 ) (13.19) This is the restoring torque that tends to reduce angular displacement \u2014 hence the negative sign. By Newton\u2019s law of rotational motion, \u03c4 = I \u03b1 (13.20) where I is the moment of inertia of the system about the support and \u03b1 is the angular acceleration.

Thus, motion repeats itself after nT where n is an integer. 2. Every periodic motion is not simple harmonic motion. Only that periodic motion governed by the force law F = \u2013 k x is simple harmonic. 3. Circular motion can arise due to an inverse-square law force (as in planetary motion) as well as due to simple harmonic force in two dimensions equal to: \u2013m\u03c92r. In the latter case, the phases of motion, in two perpendicular directions (x and y) must differ by \u03c0/2. Thus, for example, a particle subject to a force \u2013m\u03c92r with initial position (0, A) and velocity (\u03c9A, 0) will move uniformly in a circle of radius A. 4. For linear simple harmonic motion with a given \u03c9, two initial conditions are necessary and sufficient to determine the motion completely. The initial conditions may be (i) initial position and initial velocity or (ii) amplitude and phase or (iii) energy and phase. 5. From point 4 above, given amplitude or energy, phase of motion is determined by the initial position or initial velocity. 6. A combination of two simple harmonic motions with arbitrary amplitudes and phases is not necessarily periodic. It is periodic only if frequency of one motion is an integral multiple of the other\u2019s frequency. However, a periodic motion can always be expressed as a sum of infinite number of harmonic motions with appropriate amplitudes. 7.

Reprint 2025-26 CHAPTER FOURTEEN WAVES 14.1 INTRODUCTION In the previous Chapter, we studied the motion of objects oscillating in isolation. What happens in a system, which is a collection of such objects? A material medium provides such an example. Here, elastic forces bind the constituents to each other and, therefore, the motion of one affects that of the other. If you drop a little pebble in a pond of still water, the water surface gets disturbed. The disturbance does not remain confined to one place, but propagates outward along a circle."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 208, "content": "If you continue dropping pebbles in the pond, you see circles rapidly moving outward from the point where the water surface is disturbed. It gives a feeling as if the water is moving outward from the point of disturbance. If you put some cork pieces on the disturbed surface, it is seen that the cork pieces move up and down but do not move away from the centre of disturbance. This shows that the water mass does not flow outward with the circles, but rather a moving disturbance is created. Similarly, when we speak, the sound moves outward from us, without any flow of air from one part of the medium to another. The disturbances produced in air are much less obvious and only our ears or a microphone can detect them. These patterns, which move without the actual physical transfer or flow of matter as a whole, are called waves. In this Chapter, we will study such waves. Waves transport energy and the pattern of disturbance has information that propagate from one point to another. All our communications essentially depend on transmission of sig- nals through waves. Speech means production of sound waves in air and hearing amounts to their detection. Often, communication involves different kinds of waves. For exam- ple, sound waves may be first converted into an electric cur- rent signal which in turn may generate an electromagnetic wave that may be transmitted by an optical cable or via a 14.1 Introduction 14.2 Transverse and longitudinal waves 14.3 Displacement relation in a progressive wave 14.4 The speed of a travelling wave 14.5 The principle of superposition of waves 14.6 Reflection of waves 14.7 Beats Summary Points to ponder Exercises Reprint 2025-26 WAVES 279 satellite."}

Not all waves require a medium for their propagation. We know that light waves can travel through vacuum. The light emitted by stars, which are hundreds of light years away, reaches us through inter-stellar space, which is practically a vacuum. The most familiar type of waves such as waves on a string, water waves, sound waves, seismic waves, etc. is the so-called mechanical waves. These waves require a medium for propagation, they cannot propagate through vacuum. They involve oscillations of constituent particles and depend on the elastic properties of the medium. The electromagnetic waves that you will learn in Class XII are a different type of wave. Electromagnetic waves do not necessarily require a medium - they can travel through vacuum. Light, radiowaves, X-rays, are all electromagnetic waves. In vacuum, all electromagnetic waves have the same speed c, whose value is : c = 299, 792, 458 ms\u20131. (14.1) A third kind of wave is the so-called Matter waves. They are associated with constituents of matter : electrons, protons, neutrons, atoms and molecules. They arise in quantum mechanical description of nature that you will learn in your later studies. Though conceptually more abstract than mechanical or electro-magnetic waves, they have already found applications in several devices basic to modern technology; matter waves associated with electrons are employed in electron microscopes. In this chapter we will study mechanical waves, which require a material medium for their propagation. The aesthetic influence of waves on art and literature is seen from very early times; yet the first scientific analysis of wave motion dates back to the seventeenth century. Some of the famous scientists associated with the physics of wave motion are Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695), Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 210, "content": "The understanding of physics of waves followed the physics of oscillations of masses tied to springs and physics of the simple pendulum. Waves in elastic media are intimately connected with harmonic oscillations. (Stretched strings, coiled springs, air, etc., are examples of elastic media). We shall illustrate this connection through simple examples. Consider a collection of springs connected to one another as shown in Fig. 14.1. If the spring at one end is pulled suddenly and released, the disturbance travels to the other end. What has happened? The first spring is disturbed from its equilibrium length. Since the second spring is connected to the first, it is also stretched or compressed, and so on. The disturbance moves from one end to the other; but each spring only executes small oscillations about its equilibrium position. As a practical example of this situation, consider a stationary train at a railway station. Different bogies of the train are coupled to each other through a spring coupling. When an engine is attached at one end, it gives a push to the bogie next to it; this push is transmitted from one bogie to another without the entire train being bodily displaced. Now let us consider the propagation of sound waves in air. As the wave passes through air, it compresses or expands a small region of air. This causes a change in the density of that region, say \u03b4\u03c1, this change induces a change in pressure, \u03b4p, in that region. Pressure is force per unit area, so there is a restoring force proportional to the disturbance, just like in a spring. In this case, the quantity similar to extension or compression of the spring is the change in density."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 211, "content": "If a region is compressed, the molecules in that region are packed together, and they tend to move out to the adjoining region, thereby increasing the density or creating compression in the adjoining region. Consequently, the air in the first region undergoes rarefaction. If a region is comparatively rarefied the surrounding air will rush in making the rarefaction move to the adjoining region. Thus, the compression or rarefaction moves from one region to another, making the propagation of a disturbance possible in air. Fig. 14.1 A collection of springs connected to each other. The end A is pulled suddenly generating a disturbance, which then propagates to the other end. Reprint 2025-26 PHYSICS 280 In solids, similar arguments can be made. In a crystalline solid, atoms or group of atoms are arranged in a periodic lattice. In these, each atom or group of atoms is in equilibrium, due to forces from the surrounding atoms. Displacing one atom, keeping the others fixed, leads to restoring forces, exactly as in a spring. So we can think of atoms in a lattice as end points, with springs between pairs of them. In the subsequent sections of this chapter we are going to discuss various characteristic properties of waves. 14.2 TRANSVERSE AND LONGITUDINAL WAVES We have seen that motion of mechanical waves involves oscillations of constituents of the medium. If the constituents of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, we call the wave a transverse wave. If they oscillate along the direction of wave propagation, we call the wave a longitudinal wave. Fig.14.2 shows the propagation of a single pulse along a string, resulting from a single up and down jerk. If the string is very long compared position as the pulse or wave passes through them."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 212, "content": "The oscillations are normal to the direction of wave motion along the string, so this is an example of transverse wave. We can look at a wave in two ways. We can fix an instant of time and picture the wave in space. This will give us the shape of the wave as a whole in space at a given instant. Another way is to fix a location i.e. fix our attention on a particular element of string and see its oscillatory motion in time. Fig. 14.4 describes the situation for longitudinal waves in the most familiar example of the propagation of sound waves. A long pipe filled with air has a piston at one end. A single sudden push forward and pull back of the piston will generate a pulse of condensations (higher density) and rarefactions (lower density) in the medium (air). If the push-pull of the piston is continuous and periodic (sinusoidal), a Fig. 14.3 A harmonic (sinusoidal) wave travelling along a stretched string is an example of a transverse wave. An element of the string in the region of the wave oscillates about its equilibrium position perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Fig. 14.2 When a pulse travels along the length of a stretched string (x-direction), the elements of the string oscillate up and down (y- direction) to the size of the pulse, the pulse will damp out before it reaches the other end and reflection from that end may be ignored. Fig. 14.3 shows a similar situation, but this time the external agent gives a continuous periodic sinusoidal up and down jerk to one end of the string. The resulting disturbance on the string is then a sinusoidal wave. In either case the elements of the string oscillate about their equilibrium mean Fig."}

A volume element of air oscillates in the direction parallel to the direction of wave propagation. Reprint 2025-26 WAVES 281 sinusoidal wave will be generated propagating in air along the length of the pipe. This is clearly an example of longitudinal waves. The waves considered above, transverse or longitudinal, are travelling or progressive waves since they travel from one part of the medium to another. The material medium as a whole does not move, as already noted. A stream, for example, constitutes motion of water as a whole. In a water wave, it is the disturbance that moves, not water as a whole. Likewise a wind (motion of air as a whole) should not be confused with a sound wave which is a propagation of disturbance (in pressure density) in air, without the motion of air medium as a whole. In transverse waves, the particle motion is normal to the direction of propagation of the wave. Therefore, as the wave propagates, each element of the medium undergoes a shearing strain. Transverse waves can, therefore, be propagated only in those media, which can sustain shearing stress, such as solids and not in fluids. Fluids, as well as, solids can sustain compressive strain; therefore, longitudinal waves can be propagated in all elastic media. For example, in medium like steel, both transverse and longitudinal waves can propagate, while air can sustain only longitudinal waves. The waves on the surface of water are of two kinds: capillary waves and gravity waves. The former are ripples of fairly short wavelength\u2014not more than a few centimetre\u2014and the restoring force that produces them is the surface tension of water."}
{"source": "physics_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 214, "content": "Gravity waves have wavelengths typically ranging from several metres to several hundred meters. The restoring force that produces these waves is the pull of gravity, which tends to keep the water surface at its lowest level. The oscillations of the particles in these waves are not confined to the surface only, but extend with diminishing amplitude to the very bottom. The particle motion in water waves involves a complicated motion\u2014they not only move up and down but also back and forth. The waves in an ocean are the combination of both longitudinal and transverse waves. It is found that, generally, transverse and longitudinal waves travel with different speed in the same medium. u Example 14.1 Given below are some examples of wave motion. State in each case if the wave motion is transverse, longitudinal or a combination of both: (a) Motion of a kink in a longitudinal spring produced by displacing one end of the spring sideways.

Such a function at every instant should give the shape of the wave at that instant. Also, at every given location, it should describe the motion of the constituent of the medium at that location. If we wish to describe a sinusoidal travelling wave (such as the one shown in Fig. 14.3) the corresponding function must also be sinusoidal."}

Similarly, take a fixed location, say x = x0. Then, the argument of the sine function in Equation (14.2) is constant -\u03c9t. The displacement y, at a fixed location, thus, varies sinusoidally with time. That is, the constituents of the medium at different positions execute simple harmonic motion. Finally, as t increases, x must increase in the positive direction to keep kx \u2013 \u03c9t + \u03c6 constant. Thus, Eq. (14.2) represents a sinusiodal (harmonic) wave travelling along the positive direction of the x-axis."}

(14.2) for different values of time differing by equal intervals of time. In a wave, the crest is the point of maximum positive displacement, the trough is the point of maximum negative displacement. To see how a wave travels, we can fix attention on a crest and see how it progresses with time. In the figure, this is shown by a cross (\u00d7) on the crest. In the same manner, we can see the motion of a particular constituent of the medium at a fixed location, say at the origin of the x-axis. This is shown by a solid dot (\u2022). The plots of Fig. 14.6 show that with time, the solid dot (\u2022) at the origin moves periodically, i.e., the particle at the origin oscillates about its mean position as the wave progresses. This is true for any other location also. We also see that during the time the solid dot (\u2022) has completed one full oscillation, the crest has moved further by a certain distance. Using the plots of Fig. 14.6, we now define the various quantities of Eq. (14.2). 14.3.1 Amplitude and Phase In Eq. (14.2), since the sine function varies between 1 and \u20131, the displacement y (x,t) varies between a and \u2013a. We can take a to be a positive constant, without any loss of generality.

The speed is expected to be directly related to the former and inversely to the latter. For waves on a string, the restoring force is provided by the tension T in the string.

In that case, the relevant modulus of elasticity is Young\u2019s modulus, which has the same dimension as the Bulk modulus. Dimensional analysis for this case is the same as before and yields a relation like Eq. (14.18), with an undetermined C, which the exact derivation shows to be unity.

[Note for solids, the speed being referred to is the speed of longitudinal waves in the solid]. This happens because they are much more difficult to compress than gases and so have much higher values of bulk modulus. Now, see Eq. (14.19). Solids and liquids have higher mass densities ( \u03c1 ) than gases. But the corresponding increase in both the modulus (B) of solids and liquids is much higher. This is the reason why the sound waves travel faster in solids and liquids. We can estimate the speed of sound in a gas in the ideal gas approximation. For an ideal gas, the pressure P, volume V and temperature T are related by (see Chapter 10). PV = NkBT (14.21) where N is the number of molecules in volume V, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature of the gas (in Kelvin). Therefore, for an isothermal change it follows from Eq.

If we examine the basic assumption made by Newton that the pressure variations in a medium during propagation of sound are isothermal, we find that this is not correct. It was pointed out by Laplace that the pressure variations in the propagation of sound waves are so fast that there is little time for the heat flow to maintain constant temperature. These variations, therefore, are adiabatic and not isothermal.

It turns out that wave pulses continue to retain their identities after they have crossed. However, during the time they overlap, the wave pattern is different from either of the pulses. Figure 14.9 shows the situation when two pulses of equal and opposite shapes move towards each other. When the pulses overlap, the resultant displacement is the algebraic sum of the displacement due to each pulse. This is known as the principle of superposition of waves. According to this principle, each pulse moves as if others are not present. The constituents of the medium, therefore, suffer displacments due to both and since the displacements can be positive and negative, the net displacement is an algebraic sum of the two. Fig. 14.9 gives graphs of the wave shape at different times. Note the dramatic effect in the graph (c); the displacements due to the two pulses have exactly cancelled each other and there is zero displacement throughout. To put the principle of superposition mathematically, let y1 (x,t) and y2 (x,t) be the displacements due to two wave disturbances in the medium. If the waves arrive in a region simultaneously, and therefore, overlap, the net displacement y (x,t) is given by y (x, t) = y1(x, t) + y2(x, t) (14.25) If we have two or more waves moving in the medium the resultant waveform is the sum of wave functions of individual waves.

But there are familiar situations (a string fixed at either end or an air column in a pipe with either end closed) in which reflection takes place at two or more boundaries. In a string, for example, a wave travelling in one direction will get reflected at one end, which in turn will travel and get reflected from the other end. This will go on until there is a steady wave pattern set up on the string. Such wave patterns are called standing waves or stationary waves.

If the boundary is not completely rigid or is an interface between two different elastic media, the situation is some what complicated. A part of the incident wave is reflected and a part is transmitted into the second medium. If a wave is incident obliquely on the boundary between two different media the transmitted wave is called the refracted wave. The incident and refracted waves obey Snell\u2019s law of refraction, and the incident and reflected waves obey the usual laws of reflection. Fig. 14.11 shows a pulse travelling along a stretched string and being reflected by the boundary. Assuming there is no absorption of energy by the boundary, the reflected wave has the same shape as the incident pulse but it suffers a phase change of \u03c0 or 1800 on reflection. This is because the boundary is rigid and the disturbance must have zero displacement at all times at the boundary. By the principle of superposition, this is possible only if the reflected and incident waves differ by a phase of \u03c0, so that the resultant displacement is zero. This reasoning is based on boundary condition on a rigid wall. We can arrive at the same conclusion dynamically also. As the pulse arrives at the wall, it exerts a force on the wall. By Newton\u2019s Third Law, the wall exerts an equal and opposite force on the string generating a reflected pulse that differs by a phase of \u03c0. Fig."}

Thus, in this wave pattern, the amplitude varies from point-to-point, but each element of the string oscillates with the same angular frequency \u03c9 or time period. There is no phase difference between oscillations of different elements of the wave. The string as a whole vibrates in phase with differing amplitudes at different points. The wave pattern is neither moving to the right nor to the left. Hence, they are called standing or stationary waves. The amplitude is fixed at a given location but, as remarked earlier, it is different at different locations. The points at which the amplitude is zero (i.e., where there is no motion at all) are nodes; the points at which the amplitude is the largest are called antinodes.

The most significant feature of stationary waves is that the boundary conditions constrain the possible wavelengths or frequencies of vibration of the system.

Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni, Sa. Vibrations of these pillars depend on elasticity of the stone used, its density and shape. Musical pillars are categorised into three types: The first is called the Shruti Pillar, as it can produce the basic notes \u2014 the \u201cswaras\u201d. The second type is the Gana Thoongal, which generates the basic tunes that make up the \u201cragas\u201d. The third variety is the Laya Thoongal pillars that produce \u201ctaal\u201d (beats) when tapped. The pillars at the Nellaiappar temple are a combination of the Shruti and Laya types. Archaeologists date the Nelliappar temple to the 7th century and claim it was built by successive rulers of the Pandyan dynasty. The musical pillars of Nelliappar and several other temples in southern India like those at Hampi (picture), Kanyakumari, and Thiruvananthapuram are unique to the country and have no parallel in any other part of the world.

Reprint 2025-26 WAVES 295 SUMMARY 1. Mechanical waves can exist in material media and are governed by Newton\u2019s Laws. 2. Transverse waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. 3. Longitudinal waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate along the direction of wave propagation. 4. Progressive wave is a wave that moves from one point of medium to another. 5. The displacement in a sinusoidal wave propagating in the positive x direction is given by y (x, t) = a sin (kx \u2013 \u03c9t + \u03c6) where a is the amplitude of the wave, k is the angular wave number, \u03c9 is the angular frequency, (kx \u2013 \u03c9t + \u03c6) is the phase, and \u03c6 is the phase constant or phase angle. 6. Wavelength \u03bb of a progressive wave is the distance between two consecutive points of the same phase at a given time. In a stationary wave, it is twice the distance between two consecutive nodes or antinodes. 7. Period T of oscillation of a wave is defined as the time any element of the medium takes to move through one complete oscillation. It is related to the angular frequency \u03c9 through the relation T = 2\u03c0 \u03c9 8. Frequency v of a wave is defined as 1/T and is related to angular frequency by 2 \u03c9 \u03bd = \u03c0 9.

A wind is different from the sound wave in air. The former involves motion of air from one place to the other. The latter involves compressions and rarefactions of layers of air. 2. In a wave, energy and not the matter is transferred from one point to the other. 3. In a mechanical wave, energy transfer takes place because of the coupling through elastic forces between neighbouring oscillating parts of the medium. 4. Transverse waves can propagate only in medium with shear modulus of elasticity, Longitudinal waves need bulk modulus of elasticity and are therefore, possible in all media, solids, liquids and gases. 5. In a harmonic progressive wave of a given frequency, all particles have the same amplitude but different phases at a given instant of time. In a stationary wave, all particles between two nodes have the same phase at a given instant but have different amplitudes. 6. Relative to an observer at rest in a medium the speed of a mechanical wave in that medium (v) depends only on elastic and other properties (such as mass density) of the medium. It does not depend on the velocity of the source."}

Using m = Ah\u03c1, and T = 2\u03c0 k m one gets the given expression. 13.18 When both the ends are open to the atmosphere, and the difference in levels of the liquid in the two arms is h, the net force on the liquid column is Ah\u03c1g where A is the area of cross-section of the tube and \u03c1 is the density of the liquid. Since restoring force is proportional to h, motion is simple harmonic.

This gives v = RT M \u03b3 . This shows that v is: (a) Independent of pressure. (b) Increases as T . (c) The molecular mass of water (18) is less than that of N2 (28) and O2 (32). Therefore as humidity increases, the effective molecular mass of air decreases and hence v increases. 14.5 The converse is not true. An obvious requirement for an acceptable function for a travelling wave is that it should be finite everywhere and at all times. Only function (c) satisfies this condition, the remaining functions cannot possibly represent a travelling wave. 14.6 (a) 3.4 \u00d7 10\u20134 m (b) 1.49 \u00d7\u00d710\u20133 m Reprint 2025-26 306 PHYSICS 14.7 4.1 \u00d7 10\u20134 m 14.8 (a) A travelling wave.
