Transformation of matter from one kind into another occurs through the various types of reactions. One important category of such reactions is Redox Reactions. A number of phenomena, both physical as well as biological, are concerned with redox reactions. These reactions find extensive use in pharmaceutical, biological, industrial, metallurgical and agricultural areas. The importance of these reactions is apparent from the fact that burning of different types of fuels for obtaining energy for domestic, transport and other commercial purposes, electrochemical processes for extraction of highly reactive metals and non-metals, manufacturing of chemical compounds like caustic soda, operation of dry and wet batteries and corrosion of metals fall within the purview of redox processes. Of late, environmental issues like Hydrogen Economy (use of liquid hydrogen as fuel) and development of \u2018Ozone Hole\u2019 have started figuring under redox phenomenon. 7.1 CLASSICAL IDEA OF REDOX REACTIONS \u2013 OXIDATION AND REDUCTION REACTIONS Originally, the term oxidation was used to describe the addition of oxygen to an element or a compound. Because of the presence of dioxygen in the atmosphere (~20%), many elements combine with it and this is the principal reason why they commonly occur on the earth in the form of their oxides."}

Unit 7 redox reactions Where there is oxidation, there is always reduction \u2013 Chemistry is essentially a study of redox systems. Reprint 2025-26 236 chemistry In reactions (7.1) and (7.2), the elements magnesium and sulphur are oxidised on account of addition of oxygen to them. Similarly, methane is oxidised owing to the addition of oxygen to it. CH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) \u2192 CO2 (g) + 2H2O (l) (7.3) A careful examination of reaction (7.3) in which hydrogen has been replaced by oxygen prompted chemists to reinterpret oxidation in terms of removal of hydrogen from it and, therefore, the scope of term oxidation was broadened to include the removal of hydrogen from a substance. The following illustration is another reaction where removal of hydrogen can also be cited as an oxidation reaction."}

The oxidation of magnesium with fluorine, chlorine and sulphur etc. occurs according to the following reactions : Mg (s) + F2 (g) \u2192 MgF2 (s) (7.5) Mg (s) + Cl2 (g) \u2192 MgCl2 (s) (7.6) Mg (s) + S (s) \u2192 MgS (s) (7.7) Incorporating the reactions (7.5 to 7.7) within the fold of oxidation reactions encouraged chemists to consider not only the removal of hydrogen as oxidation, but also the removal of electropositive elements as oxidation. Thus the reaction : 2K4 [Fe(CN)6](aq) + H2O2 (aq) \u21922K3[Fe(CN)6](aq) + 2 KOH (aq) is interpreted as oxidation due to the removal of electropositive element potassium from potassium ferrocyanide before it changes to potassium ferricyanide. To summarise, the term \u201coxidation\u201d is defined as the addition of oxygen/electronegative element to a substance or removal of hydrogen/ electropositive element from a substance. In the beginning, reduction was considered as removal of oxygen from a compound. However, the term reduction has been broadened these days to include removal of oxygen/electronegative element from a substance or addition of hydrogen/ electropositive element to a substance."}

It was soon realised that oxidation and reduction always occur simultaneously (as will be apparent by re-examining all the equations given above), hence, the word \u201credox\u201d was coined for this class of chemical reactions. Problem 7.1 In the reactions given below, identify the species undergoing oxidation and reduction: (i) H2S (g) + Cl2 (g) \u2192 2 HCl (g) + S (s) (ii) 3Fe3O4 (s) + 8 Al (s) \u2192 9 Fe (s) + 4Al2O3 (s) (iii) 2 Na (s) + H2 (g) \u2192 2 NaH (s) Solution (i) H2S is oxidised because a more electronegative element, chlorine is added to hydrogen (or a more electropositive element, hydrogen has been removed from S).

Ferrous ferric oxide Reprint 2025-26 237 redox reactions (Fe3O4) is reduced because oxygen has been removed from it.

Simultaneously, chlorine, oxygen and sulphur are reduced because to each of these, the electropositive element sodium has been added. From our knowledge of chemical bonding we also know that sodium chloride, sodium oxide and sodium sulphide are ionic compounds and perhaps better written as Na+Cl\u2013 (s), (Na+)2O2\u2013(s), and (Na+)2 S2\u2013(s). Development of charges on the species produced suggests us to rewrite the reactions (7.12 to 7.14) in the following manner : For convenience, each of the above processes can be considered as two separate steps, one involving the loss of electrons and the other the gain of electrons. As an illustration, we may further elaborate one of these, say, the formation of sodium chloride. 2 Na(s) \u2192 2 Na+(g) + 2e\u2013 Cl2(g) + 2e\u2013 \u2192 2 Cl\u2013(g) Each of the above steps is called a half reaction, which explicitly shows involvement of electrons. Sum of the half reactions gives the overall reaction : 2 Na(s) + Cl2 (g) \u2192 2 Na+ Cl\u2013 (s) or 2 NaCl (s) Reactions 7.12 to 7.14 suggest that half reactions that involve loss of electrons are called oxidation reactions. Similarly, the half reactions that involve gain of electrons are called reduction reactions. It may not be out of context to mention here that the new way of defining oxidation and reduction has been achieved only by establishing a correlation between the behaviour of species as per the classical idea and their interplay in electron-transfer change."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 5, "content": "In reactions (7.12 to 7.14) sodium, which is oxidised, acts as a reducing agent because it donates electron to each of the elements interacting with it and thus helps in reducing them. Chlorine, oxygen and sulphur are reduced and act as oxidising agents because these accept electrons from sodium. To summarise, we may mention that Oxidation : Loss of electron(s) by any species. Reduction : Gain of electron(s) by any species. Oxidising agent : Acceptor of electron(s). Reducing agent : Donor of electron(s). Problem 7.2 Justify that the reaction: 2 Na(s) + H2(g) \u2192 2 NaH (s) is a redox change. Solution Since in the above reaction the compound formed is an ionic compound, which may also be represented as Na+H\u2013 (s), this suggests that one half reaction in this process is : 2 Na (s) \u2192 2 Na+(g) + 2e\u2013 Reprint 2025-26 238 chemistry and the other half reaction is: H2 (g) + 2e\u2013 \u2192 2 H\u2013(g) This splitting of the reaction under examination into two half reactions automatically reveals that here sodium is oxidised and hydrogen is reduced, therefore, the complete reaction is a redox change. 7.2.1 Competitive Electron Transfer Reactions Place a strip of metallic zinc in an aqueous solution of copper nitrate as shown in Fig. 7.1, for about one hour. You may notice that the strip becomes coated with reddish metallic copper and the blue colour of the solution disappears. Formation of Zn2+ ions among the products can easily be judged when the blue colour of the solution due to Cu2+ has disappeared. If hydrogen sulphide gas is passed through the colourless solution containing Zn2+ ions, appearance of white zinc sulphide, ZnS can be seen on making the solution alkaline with ammonia."}

Evidently, now if zinc is oxidised, releasing electrons, something must be reduced, accepting the electrons lost by zinc. Copper ion is reduced by gaining electrons from the zinc. Reaction (7.15) may be rewritten as : At this stage we may investigate the state of equilibrium for the reaction represented by equation (7.15). For this purpose, let us place a strip of metallic copper in a zinc sulphate solution. No visible reaction is noticed and attempt to detect the presence of Cu2+ ions by passing H2S gas through the solution to produce the black colour of cupric sulphide, CuS, does not succeed. Cupric sulphide has such a low solubility that this is an extremely sensitive test; yet the amount of Cu2+ formed cannot be detected. We thus conclude that the state of equilibrium for the reaction (7.15) greatly favours the products over the reactants. Let us extend electron transfer reaction now to copper metal and silver nitrate solution in water and arrange a set-up as shown in Fig. 7.2. The solution develops blue colour due to the formation of Cu2+ ions on account of the reaction: Fig. 7.1 Redox reaction between zinc and aqueous solution of copper nitrate occurring in a beaker. (7.16) Here, Cu(s) is oxidised to Cu2+(aq) and Ag+(aq) is reduced to Ag(s). Equilibrium greatly favours the products Cu2+ (aq) and Ag(s).

At equilibrium, chemical tests reveal that both Ni2+(aq) and Co2+(aq) are present at moderate concentrations. In this case, neither the reactants [Co(s) and Ni2+(aq)] nor the products [Co2+(aq) and Ni (s)] are greatly favoured. This competition for release of electrons incidently reminds us of the competition for release of protons among acids. The similarity suggests that we might develop a table in which metals and their ions are listed on the basis of their tendency to release electrons just as we do in the case of acids to indicate the strength of the acids. As a matter of fact we have already made certain comparisons. By comparison we have come to know that zinc releases electrons to copper and copper releases electrons to silver and, therefore, the electron releasing tendency of the metals is in the order: Zn>Cu>Ag. We would love to make our list more vast and design a metal activity series or electrochemical series. The competition for electrons between various metals helps us to design a class of cells, named as Galvanic cells in which the chemical reactions become the source of electrical energy. We would study more about these cells in Class XII. 7.3 OXIDATION NUMBER A less obvious example of electron transfer is realised when hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water by the reaction: 2H2(g) + O2 (g) \u2192 2H2O (l) (7.18) Though not simple in its approach, yet we can visualise the H atom as going from a neutral (zero) state in H2 to a positive state in H2O, the O atom goes from a zero state in O2 to a dinegative state in H2O."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 8, "content": "It is assumed that there is an electron transfer from H to O and consequently H2 is oxidised and O2 is reduced. However, as we shall see later, the charge transfer is only partial and is perhaps better described as an electron shift rather than a complete loss of electron by H and gain by O. What has been said here with respect to equation (7.18) may be true for a good number of other reactions involving covalent compounds. Two such examples of this class of the reactions are: H2(s) + Cl2(g) \u2192 2HCl(g) (7.19) and, CH 4(g) + 4Cl2(g) \u2192 CCl4(l) + 4HCl(g) (7.20) In order to keep track of electron shifts in chemical reactions involving formation of covalent compounds, a more practical method of using oxidation number has been developed. In this method, it is always assumed that there is a complete transfer of electron from a less electronegative atom to a more electonegative atom. For example, we rewrite equations (7.18 to 7.20) to show charge on each of the atoms forming part of the reaction : 0 0 +1 \u20132 2H2(g) + O2(g) \u2192 2H2O (l) (7.21) 0 0 +1 \u20131 H2 (s) + Cl2(g) \u2192 2HCl(g) (7.22) \u20134+1 0 +4 \u20131 +1 \u20131 CH4(g) + 4Cl2(g) \u2192 CCl4(l) +4HCl(g) (7.23) It may be emphasised that the assumption of electron transfer is made for book-keeping purpose only and it will become obvious at a later stage in this unit that it leads to the simple description of redox reactions. Oxidation number denotes the oxidation state of an element in a compound ascertained according to a set of rules formulated on the basis that electron pair Reprint 2025-26 240 chemistry in a covalent bond belongs entirely to more electronegative element."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 9, "content": "It is not always possible to remember or make out easily in a compound/ion, which element is more electronegative than the other. Therefore, a set of rules has been formulated to determine the oxidation number of an element in a compound/ion. If two or more than two atoms of an element are present in the molecule/ion such as Na2S2O3/Cr2O7 2\u2013, the oxidation number of the atom of that element will then be the average of the oxidation number of all the atoms of that element. We may at this stage, state the rules for the calculation of oxidation number. These rules are: 1. In elements, in the free or the uncombined state, each atom bears an oxidation number of zero. Evidently each atom in H2, O2, Cl2, O3, P4, S8, Na, Mg, Al has the oxidation number zero. 2. For ions composed of only one atom, the oxidation number is equal to the charge on the ion. Thus Na+ ion has an oxidation number of +1, Mg2+ ion, +2, Fe3+ ion, +3, Cl\u2013 ion, \u20131, O2\u2013 ion, \u20132; and so on. In their compounds all alkali metals have oxidation number of +1, and all alkaline earth metals have an oxidation number of +2. Aluminium is regarded to have an oxidation number of +3 in all its compounds. 3. The oxidation number of oxygen in most compounds is \u20132. However, we come across two kinds of exceptions here. One arises in the case of peroxides and superoxides, the compounds of oxygen in which oxygen atoms are directly linked to each other. While in peroxides (e.g., H2O2, Na2O2), each oxygen atom is assigned an oxidation number of \u20131, in superoxides (e.g., KO2, RbO2) each oxygen atom is assigned an oxidation number of \u2013(\u00bd). The second exception appears rarely, i.e."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 10, "content": "when oxygen is bonded to fluorine. In such compounds e.g., oxygen difluoride (OF2) and dioxygen difluoride (O2F2), the oxygen is assigned an oxidation number of +2 and +1, respectively. The number assigned to oxygen will depend upon the bonding state of oxygen but this number would now be a positive figure only. 4. The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1, except when it is bonded to metals in binary compounds (that is compounds containing two elements). For example, in LiH, NaH, and CaH2, its oxidation number is \u20131. 5. In all its compounds, fluorine has an oxidation number of \u20131. Other halogens (Cl, Br, and I) also have an oxidation number of \u20131, when they occur as halide ions in their compounds. Chlorine, bromine and iodine when combined with oxygen, for example in oxoacids and oxoanions, have positive oxidation numbers. 6. The algebraic sum of the oxidation number of all the atoms in a compound must be zero. In polyatomic ion, the algebraic sum of all the oxidation numbers of atoms of the ion must equal the charge on the ion. Thus, the sum of oxidation number of three oxygen atoms and one carbon atom in the carbonate ion, (CO3)2\u2013 must equal \u20132. By the application of above rules, we can find out the oxidation number of the desired element in a molecule or in an ion. It is clear that the metallic elements have positive oxidation number and nonmetallic elements have positive or negative oxidation number. The atoms of transition elements usually display several positive oxidation states. The highest oxidation number of a representative element is the group number for the first two groups and the group number minus 10 (following the long form of periodic table) for the other groups."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 11, "content": "Thus, it implies that the highest value of oxidation number exhibited by an atom of an element generally increases across the period in the periodic table. In the third period, the highest value of oxidation number changes from 1 to 7 as indicated below in the compounds of the elements. A term that is often used interchangeably with the oxidation number is the oxidation state. Thus in CO2, the oxidation state of carbon is +4, that is also its oxidation number and similarly the oxidation state as well as oxidation number of oxygen is \u2013 2. This implies that the oxidation number denotes the oxidation state of an element in a compound. Reprint 2025-26 241 redox reactions The oxidation number/state of a metal in a compound is sometimes presented according to the notation given by German chemist, Alfred Stock. It is popularly known as Stock notation. According to this, the oxidation number is expressed by putting a Roman numeral representing the oxidation number in parenthesis after the symbol of the metal in the molecular formula. Thus aurous chloride and auric chloride are written as Au(I)Cl and Au(III)Cl3. Similarly, stannous chloride and stannic chloride are written as Sn(II)Cl2 and Sn(IV)Cl4. This change in oxidation number implies change in oxidation state, which in turn helps to identify whether the species is present in oxidised form or reduced form. Thus, Hg2(I)Cl2 is the reduced form of Hg(II) Cl2. Problem 7.3 Using Stock notation, represent the following compounds :HAuCl4, Tl2O, FeO, Fe2O3, CuI, CuO, MnO and MnO2."}

The idea of oxidation number has been invariably applied to define oxidation, reduction, oxidising agent (oxidant), reducing agent (reductant) and the redox reaction. To summarise, we may say that: Oxidation: An increase in the oxidation number of the element in the given substance. Reduction : A decrease in the oxidation number of the element in the given substance. Oxidising agent: A reagent which can increase the oxidation number of an element in a given substance. These reagents are called as oxidants also. Reducing agent: A reagent which lowers the oxidation number of an element in a given substance. These reagents are also called as reductants.

Combination reactions A combination reaction may be denoted in the manner: A + B \u2192 C Either A and B or both A and B must be in the elemental form for such a reaction to be a redox reaction.

Very less active metals, which may occur in the native state such as silver (Ag), and gold (Au) do not react even with hydrochloric acid. In section (7.2.1) we have already discussed that the metals \u2013 zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) through tendency to lose electrons show their reducing activity in the order Zn> Cu>Ag. Like metals, activity series also exists for the halogens. The power of these elements as oxidising agents decreases as we move down from fluorine to iodine in group 17 of the periodic table. This implies that fluorine is so reactive that it can replace chloride, bromide and iodide ions in solution. In fact, fluorine is so reactive that it attacks water and displaces the oxygen of water : +1 \u20132 0 +1 \u20131 0 2H2O (l) + 2F2 (g) \u2192 4HF(aq) + O2(g) (7.40) It is for this reason that the displacement reactions of chlorine, bromine and iodine using fluorine are not generally carried out in aqueous solution."}

(a) Oxidation Number Method: In writing equations for oxidation-reduction reactions, just as for other reactions, the compositions and formulas must be known for the substances that react and for the products that are formed. The oxidation number method is now best illustrated in the following steps: Step 1: Write the correct formula for each reactant and product. Step 2: Identify atoms which undergo change in oxidation number in the reaction by assigning the oxidation number to all elements in the reaction. Step 3: Calculate the increase or decrease in the oxidation number per atom and for the entire molecule/ion in which it occurs. If these are not equal then multiply by suitable number so that these become equal. (If you realise that two substances are reduced and nothing is oxidised or vice-versa, something is wrong.

Similarly, in redox systems, the titration method can be adopted to determine the strength of a reductant/ oxidant using a redox sensitive indicator. The usage of indicators in redox titration is illustrated below: (i) In one situation, the reagent itself is intensely coloured, e.g., permanganate ion, MnO4 \u2013. Here MnO4 \u2013 acts as the self indicator. The visible end point in this case is achieved after the last of the reductant (Fe2+ or C2O4 2\u2013) is oxidised and the first lasting tinge of pink colour appears at MnO4 \u2013 concentration as low as 10\u20136 mol dm\u20133 (10\u20136 mol L\u20131). This ensures a minimal \u2018overshoot\u2019 in colour beyond the equivalence point, the point where the reductant and the oxidant are equal in terms of their mole stoichiometry. (ii) If there is no dramatic auto-colour change (as with MnO4 \u2013 titration), there are indicators which are oxidised immediately after the last bit of the reactant is consumed, producing a dramatic colour change. The best example is afforded by Cr2O7 2\u2013, which is not a self-indicator, but oxidises the indicator substance diphenylamine just after the equivalence point to produce an intense blue colour, thus signalling the end point. (iii) There is yet another method which is interesting and quite common."}

Thus, the end-point can easily be tracked and the rest is the stoichiometric calculation only. 7.3.4 Limitations of Concept of Oxidation Number As you have observed in the above discussion, the concept of redox processes has been evolving with time. This process of evolution is continuing. In fact, in recent past the oxidation process is visualised as a decrease in electron density and reduction process as an increase in electron density around the atom(s) involved in the reaction. 7.4 Redox Reactions and Electrode Processes The experiment corresponding to reaction (7.15), can also be observed if zinc rod is dipped in copper sulphate solution. The redox reaction takes place and during the Reprint 2025-26 250 chemistry reaction, zinc is oxidised to zinc ions and copper ions are reduced to metallic copper due to direct transfer of electrons from zinc to copper ion. During this reaction heat is also evolved. Now we modify the experiment in such a manner that for the same redox reaction transfer of electrons takes place indirectly. This necessitates the separation of zinc metal from copper sulphate solution."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 31, "content": "We take copper sulphate solution in a beaker and put a copper strip or rod in it. We also take zinc sulphate solution in another beaker and put a zinc rod or strip in it. Now reaction takes place in either of the beakers and at the interface of the metal and its salt solution in each beaker both the reduced and oxidized forms of the same species are present. These represent the species in the reduction and oxidation half reactions. A redox couple is defined as having together the oxidised and reduced forms of a substance taking part in an oxidation or reduction half reaction. This is represented by separating the oxidised form from the reduced form by a vertical line or a slash representing an interface (e.g. solid/solution). For example in this experiment the two redox couples are represented as Zn2+/Zn and Cu2+/Cu. In both cases, oxidised form is put before the reduced form. Now we put the beaker containing copper sulphate solution and the beaker containing zinc sulphate solution side by side (Fig. 7.3). We connect solutions in two beakers by a salt bridge (a U-tube containing a solution of potassium chloride or ammonium nitrate usually solidified by boiling with agar agar and later cooling to a jelly like substance). This provides an electric contact between the two solutions without allowing them to mix with each other. The zinc and copper rods are connected by a metallic wire with a provision for an ammeter and a switch. The set-up as shown in Fig.7.3 is known as Daniell cell. When the switch is in the off position, no reaction takes place in either of the beakers and no current flows through the metallic wire."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 32, "content": "As soon as the switch is in the on position, we make the following observations: 1. The transfer of electrons now does not take place directly from Zn to Cu2+ but through the metallic wire connecting the two rods as is apparent from the arrow which indicates the flow of current. 2. The electricity from solution in one beaker to solution in the other beaker flows by the migration of ions through the salt bridge. We know that the flow of current is possible only if there is a potential difference between the copper and zinc rods known as electrodes here. The potential associated with each electrode is known as electrode potential. If the concentration of each species taking part in the electrode reaction is unity (if any gas appears in the electrode reaction, it is confined to 1 atmospheric pressure) and further the reaction is carried out at 298K, then the potential of each electrode is said to be the Standard Electrode Potential. By convention, the standard electrode potential (E\uf030) of hydrogen electrode is 0.00 volts. The electrode potential value for each electrode process is a measure of the relative tendency of the active species in the process to remain in the oxidised/reduced form. A negative E\uf030 means that the redox couple is a stronger Fig.7.3 The set-up for Daniell cell. Electrons produced at the anode due to oxidation of Zn travel through the external circuit to the cathode where these reduce the copper ions. The circuit is completed inside the cell by the migration of ions through the salt bridge. It may be noted that the direction of current is opposite to the direction of electron flow."}

Reprint 2025-26 252 chemistry SUMMARY Redox reactions form an important class of reactions in which oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously. Three tier conceptualisation viz, classical, electronic and oxidation number, which is usually available in the texts, has been presented in detail. Oxidation, reduction, oxidising agent (oxidant) and reducing agent (reductant) have been viewed according to each conceptualisation. Oxidation numbers are assigned in accordance with a consistent set of rules. Oxidation number and ion-electron method both are useful means in writing equations for the redox reactions. Redox reactions are classified into four categories: combination, decomposition displacement and disproportionation reactions. The concept of redox couple and electrode processes is introduced here. The redox reactions find wide applications in the study of electrode processes and cells.

This unit incorporates some basic principles and techniques of analysis required for understanding the formation and properties of organic compounds. 8.1 General Introduction Organic compounds are vital for sustaining life on earth and include complex molecules like genetic information bearing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and proteins that constitute essential compounds of our blood, muscles and skin. Organic compounds appear in materials like clothing, fuels, polymers, dyes and medicines. These are some of the important areas of application of these compounds. Science of organic chemistry is about two hundred years old. Around the year 1780, chemists began to distinguish between organic compounds obtained from plants and animals and inorganic compounds prepared from mineral sources. Berzilius, a Swedish chemist proposed that a \u2018vital force\u2019 was responsible for the formation of organic compounds. However, this notion was rejected in 1828 when F. Wohler synthesised an organic compound, urea from an inorganic compound, ammonium cyanate.

{"source": "chemistry_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 41, "content": "Also, you already know that tetravalence of carbon and the formation of covalent bonds by it are explained in terms of its electronic configuration and the hybridisation of s and p orbitals. It may be recalled that formation and the shapes of molecules like methane (CH4), ethene (C2H4), ethyne (C2H2) are explained in terms of the use of sp3, sp2 and sp hybrid orbitals by carbon atoms in the respective molecules. Hybridisation influences the bond length and bond enthalpy (strength) in compounds. The sp hybrid orbital contains more s character and hence it is closer to its nucleus and forms shorter and stronger bonds than the sp3 hybrid orbital. The sp2 hybrid orbital is intermediate in s character between sp and sp3 and, hence, the length and enthalpy of the bonds it forms, are also intermediate between them. The change in hybridisation affects the electronegativity of carbon. The greater the s character of the hybrid orbitals, the greater is the electronegativity. Thus, a carbon atom having an sp hybrid orbital with 50% s character is more electronegative than that possessing sp2 or sp3 hybridised orbitals. This relative electronegativity is reflected in several physical and chemical properties of the molecules concerned, about which you will learn in later units. 8.2.2 Some Characteristic Features of \u03c0 Bonds In a \u03c0 (pi) bond formation, parallel orientation of the two p orbitals on adjacent atoms is necessary for a proper sideways overlap. Thus, in H2C=CH2 molecule all the atoms must be in the same plane. The p orbitals are mutually parallel and both the p orbitals are perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. Rotation of one CH2 fragment with respect to other interferes with maximum overlap of p orbitals and, therefore, such rotation about carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) is restricted."}

The Lewis structure or dot structure, dash structure, condensed structure and bond line structural formulas are some of the specific types. The Lewis structures, however, can be simplified by representing the two-electron covalent bond by a dash (\u2013). Such a structural formula focuses on the electrons involved in bond formation. A single dash represents a single bond, double dash is used for double bond and a triple dash represents triple bond. Lone- pairs of electrons on heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, halogens etc.) may or may not be shown."}

Such structural representations are called complete structural formulas. Similarly, CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 can be further condensed to CH3(CH2)6CH3. For further simplification, organic chemists use another way of representing the structures, in which only lines are used. In this bond-line structural representation of organic compounds, carbon and hydrogen atoms are not shown and the lines representing carbon-carbon bonds are drawn in a zig-zag fashion. The only atoms specifically written are oxygen, chlorine, nitrogen etc. The terminals denote methyl (\u2013CH3) groups (unless indicated otherwise by a functional group), while the line junctions denote carbon atoms bonded to appropriate number of hydrogens required to satisfy the valency of the carbon atoms.

For example, by using solid ( ) and dashed ( ) wedge formula, the 3-D image of a molecule from a two-dimensional picture can be perceived. In these formulas the solid-wedge is used to indicate a bond projecting out of the plane of paper, towards the observer. The dashed-wedge is used to depict the bond projecting out of the plane of the paper and away from the observer. Wedges are shown in such a way that the broad end of the wedge is towards the observer.

Organic compounds are broadly classified as follows: I. Acyclic or open chain compounds These compounds are also called as aliphatic compounds and consist of straight or branched chain compounds, for example: (homocyclic). Cyclohexene Cyclohexane Cyclopropane Sometimes atoms other than carbon are also present in the ring (heterocylic). Tetrahydrofuran given below is an example of this type of compound: Tetrahydrofuran These exhibit some of the properties similar to those of aliphatic compounds. (b) Aromatic compounds Aromatic compounds are special types of compounds. You will learn about these compounds in detail in Unit 9. These include benzene and other related ring compounds (benzenoid).

The examples are hydroxyl group (\u2013OH), aldehyde group (\u2013CHO) and carboxylic acid group (\u2013 COOH) etc. 8.4.2 Homologous Series A group or a series of organic compounds each containing a characteristic functional group forms a homologous series and the members of the series are called homologues. The members of a homologous series can be represented by general molecular formula and the successive members differ from each other in molecular formula by a \u2013Ch2 unit. There are a number of homologous series of organic compounds. Some of these are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, haloalkanes, alkanols, alkanals, alkanones, alkanoic acids, amines etc. It is also possible that a compound contains two or more identical or different functional groups. This gives rise to polyfunctional compounds. 8.5 NOMENCLATURE OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS Organic chemistry deals with millions of compounds. In order to clearly identify them, a systematic method of naming has been developed and is known as the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) system of nomenclature. In this systematic nomenclature, the names are correlated with the structure such that the reader or listener can deduce the structure from the name."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 47, "content": "Before the IUPAC system of nomenclature, however, organic compounds were assigned names based on their origin or certain properties. For instance, citric acid is named so because it is found in citrus fruits and the acid found in red ant is named formic acid since the Latin word for ant is formica. These names are traditional and are considered as trivial or common names. Some common names are followed even today. For example, Buckminsterfullerene is a common name given to the newly discovered C60 cluster (a form of carbon) noting its structural similarity to the geodesic domes popularised by the famous architect R. Buckminster Fuller. Common names are useful and in many cases indispensable, particularly when the alternative systematic names are lengthy and complicated. Common names of some organic compounds are given in Table 8.1. Table 8.1 Common or Trivial Names of Some Organic Compounds 8.5.1 The IUPAC System of Nomenclature A systematic name of an organic compound is generally derived by identifying the parent hydrocarbon and the functional group(s) attached to it. See the example given below. Reprint 2025-26 263 organic chemistry \u2013 some basic principles and techniques By further using prefixes and suffixes, the parent name can be modified to obtain the actual name. Compounds containing carbon and hydrogen only are called hydrocarbons. A hydrocarbon is termed saturated if it contains only carbon-carbon single bonds. The IUPAC name for a homologous series of such compounds is alkane. Paraffin (Latin: little affinity) was the earlier name given to these compounds. Unsaturated hydrocarbons are those, which contain at least one carbon- carbon double or triple bond."}

The IUPAC names of some straight chain saturated hydrocarbons are given in Table 8.2. The alkanes in Table 8.2 differ from each other by merely the number of -CH2 groups in the chain. They are homologues of alkane series. In order to name such compounds, the names of alkyl groups are prefixed to the name of parent alkane. An alkyl group is derived from a saturated hydrocarbon by removing a hydrogen atom from carbon. Thus, CH4 becomes -CH3 and is called methyl group. An alkyl group is named by substituting \u2018yl\u2019 for \u2018ane\u2019 in the corresponding alkane. Some alkyl groups are listed in Table 8.3.

Examples of some functional groups with their prefixes and suffixes along with some examples of organic compounds possessing these are given in Table 8.4. First of all, the functional group present in the molecule is identified which determines the choice of appropriate suffix. The longest chain of carbon atoms containing the functional group is numbered in such a way that the functional group is attached at the carbon atom possessing lowest possible number in the chain. By using the suffix as given in Table 8.4, the name of the compound is arrived at. In the case of polyfunctional compounds, one of the functional groups is chosen as the principal functional group and the compound is then named on that basis. The remaining functional groups, which are subordinate functional groups, are named as substituents using the appropriate prefixes. The choice of principal functional group is made on the basis of order of preference. The order of decreasing priority for some functional groups is: -COOH, \u2013SO3H, -COOR (R=alkyl group), COCl, -CONH2, -CN,-HC=O, >C=O, -OH, -NH2, > C=C<, -C\u2261C- .

In heterolytic cleavage, the bond breaks in such a fashion that the shared pair of electrons remains with one of the fragments. After heterolysis, one atom has a sextet electronic structure and a positive charge and the other, a valence octet with at least one lone pair and a negative charge.

Thus, the shape of C + H3 may be considered as being derived from the overlap of three equivalent C(sp2) hybridised orbitals with 1s orbital of each of the three hydrogen Organic molecule (Substrate) [Intermediate] Product(s) Attacking Reagent Byproducts Substrate is that reactant which supplies carbon to the new bond and the other reactant is called reagent. If both the reactants supply carbon to the new bond then choice is arbitrary and in that case the molecule on which attention is focused is called substrate. In such a reaction a covalent bond between two carbon atoms or a carbon and some other atom is broken and a new bond is formed. A sequential account of each step, describing details of electron movement, energetics during bond cleavage and bond formation, and the rates of transformation of reactants into products (kinetics) is referred to as reaction mechanism."}

Fig. 8.3 (a) Shape of methyl carbocation The heterolytic cleavage can also give a species in which carbon gets the shared pair of electrons. For example, when group Z attached to the carbon leaves without electron pair, the methyl anion is formed. Such a carbon species carrying a negative charge on carbon atom is called carbanion. Carbon in carbanion is generally sp3 hybridised and its structure is distorted tetrahedron as shown in Fig. 8.3(b). Fig. 8.3 (b) Shape of methyl carbanion Carbanions are also unstable and reactive species. The organic reactions which proceed through heterolytic bond cleavage are called ionic or heteropolar or just polar reactions. In homolytic cleavage, one of the electrons of the shared pair in a covalent bond goes with each of the bonded atoms. Thus, in homolytic cleavage, the movement of a single electron takes place instead of an electron pair. The single electron movement is shown by \u2018half-headed\u2019 (fish hook: ) curved arrow. Such cleavage results in the formation of neutral species (atom or group) which contains an unpaired electron. These species are called free radicals. Like carbocations and carbanions, free radicals are also very reactive. A homolytic cleavage can be shown as: Alkyl free radical Alkyl radicals are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Alkyl radical stability increases as we proceed from primary to tertiary: , Methyl Ethyl Isopropyl Tert-butyl free free free free radical radical radical radical Organic reactions, which proceed by homolytic fission are called free radical or homopolar or nonpolar reactions."}

Molecules as such participate in the reaction. It is convenient to name one reagent as substrate and other as reagent. In general, a molecule whose carbon is involved in new bond formation is called substrate and the other one is called reagent. When carbon-carbon bond is formed, the choice of naming the reactants as substrate and reagent is arbitrary and depends on molecule under observation. Example: (i) CH2 = CH2 + Br2 \u2192 CH2 Br \u2013 CH2Br Substrate Reagent Product (ii) Nucleophiles and Electrophiles Reagents attack the reactive site of the substrate. The reactive site may be electron Reprint 2025-26 273 organic chemistry \u2013 some basic principles and techniques deficient portion of the molecule (a positive reactive site) e.g., an atom with incomplete electron shell or the positive end of the dipole in the molecule. If the attacking species is electron rich, it attacks these sites. If attacking species is electron deficient, the reactive site for it is that part of the substrate molecule which can supply electrons, e.g., \u03c0 electrons in a double bond. A reagent that brings an electron pair to the reactive site is called a nucleophile (Nu:) i.e., nucleus seeking and the reaction is then called nucleophilic. A reagent that takes away an electron pair from reactive site is called electrophile (E+) i.e., electron seeking and the reaction is called electrophilic. During a polar organic reaction, a nucleophile attacks an electrophilic centre of the substrate which is that specific atom or part of the substrate which is electron deficient. Similarly, the electrophiles attack at nucleophilic centre, which is the electron rich centre of the substrate. Thus, the electrophiles receive electron pair from the substrate when the two undergo bonding interaction."}

Some examples of nucleophiles are the negatively charged ions with lone pair of electrons such as hydroxide (HO\u2013 ), cyanide (NC\u2013) ions and carbanions (R3C:\u2013). Neutral molecules such as etc., can also act as nucleophiles due to the presence of lone pair of electrons. Examples of electrophiles include carbocations (C + H3) and neutral molecules having functional groups like carbonyl group (>C=O) or alkyl halides (R3C-X, where X is a halogen atom). The carbon atom in carbocations has sextet configuration; hence, it is electron deficient and can receive a pair of electrons from the nucleophiles. In neutral molecules such as alkyl halides, due to the polarity of the C-X bond a partial positive charge is generated on the carbon atom and hence the carbon atom becomes an electrophilic centre at which a nucleophile can attack.

For example, in transfer of hydroxide ion giving ethanol and in the dissociation of chloromethane, the movement of electron using curved arrows can be depicted as follows: 8.7.4 Electron Displacement Effects in Covalent Bonds The electron displacement in an organic molecule may take place either in the ground state under the influence of an atom or a substituent group or in the presence of an appropriate attacking reagent. The electron displacements due to the influence of an atom or a substituent group present in the molecule cause permanent polarlisation of the bond. Inductive effect and resonance effects are examples of this type of electron displacements. Temporary electron displacement effects are seen in a molecule when a reagent approaches to attack it. This type of electron displacement is called electromeric effect or polarisability effect. In the following sections we will learn about these types of electronic displacements. 8.7.5 Inductive Effect When a covalent bond is formed between atoms of different electronegativity, the electron density is more towards the more electronegative atom of the bond. Such a shift of electron density results in a polar covalent bond. Bond polarity leads to various electronic effects in organic compounds."}

It is polarised in such a way that the carbon-1 gains some positive charge (\u03b4+) and the chlorine some negative charge (\u03b4\u2013). The fractional electronic charges on the two atoms in a polar covalent bond are denoted by symbol \u03b4 (delta) and the shift of electron density is shown by an arrow that points from \u03b4+ to \u03b4\u2013 end of the polar bond. \u03b4\u03b4+ \u03b4+ \u03b4\u2212 CH3\uf8e7\u2192\uf8e7CH2\uf8e7\u2192\uf8e7Cl 2 1 In turn carbon-1, which has developed partial positive charge (\u03b4+) draws some electron density towards it from the adjacent C-C bond. Consequently, some positive charge (\u03b4\u03b4+) develops on carbon-2 also, where \u03b4\u03b4+ symbolises relatively smaller positive charge as compared to that on carbon \u2013 1. In other words, the polar C \u2013 Cl bond induces polarity in the adjacent bonds. Such polarisation of \u03c3-bond caused by the polarisation of adjacent \u03c3-bond is referred to as the inductive effect. This effect is passed on to the subsequent bonds also but the effect decreases rapidly as the number of intervening bonds increases and becomes vanishingly small after three bonds. The inductive effect is related to the ability of substituent(s) to either withdraw or donate electron density to the attached carbon atom. Based on this ability, the substitutents can be classified as electron-withdrawing or electron donating groups relative to hydrogen. Halogens and many other groups such as nitro (- NO2), cyano (- CN), carboxy (- COOH), ester (COOR), aryloxy (-OAr, e.g. \u2013 OC6H5), etc. are electron-withdrawing groups. On the other hand, the alkyl groups like methyl (\u2013CH3) and ethyl (\u2013CH2\u2013CH3) are usually considered as electron donating groups."}

An example is that of benzene. Its cyclic structure containing alternating C\u2013C single and C=C double bonds shown is inadequate for explaining its characteristic properties. As per the above representation, benzene should exhibit two different bond lengths, due to C\u2013C single and C=C double bonds. However, as determined experimentally benzene has a uniform C\u2013C bond distances of 139 pm, a value intermediate between the C\u2013C single(154 pm) and C=C double (134 pm) bonds. Thus, the structure of benzene cannot be represented adequately by the above structure. Further, benzene can be represented equally well by the energetically identical structures I and II. benzene cannot be adequately represented by any of these structures, rather it is a hybrid of the two structures (I and II) called resonance structures. The resonance structures (canonical structures or contributing structures) are hypothetical and individually do not represent any real molecule. They contribute to the actual structure in proportion to their stability. Another example of resonance is provided by nitromethane (CH3NO2) which can be represented by two Lewis structures, (I and II). There are two types of N-O bonds in these structures."}

The actual structure of nitromethane is therefore a resonance hybrid of the two canonical forms I and II. The energy of actual structure of the molecule (the resonance hybrid) is lower than that of any of the canonical structures. The difference in energy between the actual structure and the lowest energy resonance structure is called the resonance stabilisation energy or simply the resonance energy. The more the number of important contributing structures, the more is the resonance energy. Resonance is particularly important when the contributing structures are equivalent in energy. The following rules are applied while writing resonance structures: The resonance structures have (i) the same positions of nuclei and (ii) the same number of unpaired electrons. Among the resonance structures, the one which has more number of covalent bonds, all the atoms with octet of electrons (except hydrogen which has a duplet), less separation of opposite charges, (a negative charge if any on more electronegative atom, a positive charge if any on more electropositive atom) and more dispersal of charge, is more stable than others.

The effect is transmitted through the chain. There are two types of resonance or mesomeric effect designated as R or M effect. (i) Positive Resonance Effect (+R effect) In this effect, the transfer of electrons is away from an atom or substituent group attached to the conjugated system. This electron displacement makes certain positions in the molecule of high electron densities. This effect in aniline is shown as : Stability: I > II > III [I: Most stable, more number of covalent bonds, each carbon and oxygen atom has an octet and no separation of opposite charge II: negative charge on more electronegative atom and positive charge on more electropositive atom; III: does not contribute as oxygen has positive charge and carbon has negative charge, hence least stable].

These systems often show abnormal behaviour. The examples are 1,3- butadiene, aniline and nitrobenzene etc. In such systems, the \u03c0-electrons are delocalised and the system develops polarity. 8.7.8 Electromeric Effect (E effect) It is a temporary effect. The organic compounds having a multiple bond (a double or triple bond) show this effect in the presence of an attacking reagent only. It is defined as the complete transfer of a shared pair of \u03c0-electrons to one of the atoms joined by a multiple bond on the demand of an attacking reagent. The effect is annulled as soon as the attacking reagent is removed from the domain of the reaction. It is represented by E and the shifting of the electrons is shown by a curved arrow ( ). There are two distinct types of electromeric effect. (i) Positive Eelctromeric Effect (+E effect) In this effect the \u03c0\u2212electrons of the multiple bond are transferred to that atom to which the reagent gets attached.

It involves delocalisation of \u03c3 electrons of C\u2014H bond of an alkyl group directly attached to an atom of unsaturated Fig. 8.4(a) Orbital diagram showing hyperconjugation in ethyl cation This type of overlap stabilises the carbocation because electron density from the adjacent \u03c3 bond helps in dispersing the positive charge.

The common techniques used for purification are as follows : (i) Sublimation (ii) Crystallisation (iii) Distillation (iv) Differential extraction and (v) Chromatography Finally, the purity of a compound is ascertained by determining its melting or boiling point.

It is based on the difference in the solubilities of the compound and the impurities in a suitable solvent. The impure compound is dissolved in a solvent in which it is sparingly soluble at room temperature but appreciably soluble at higher temperature. The solution is concentrated to get a nearly saturated solution. On cooling the solution, pure compound crystallises out and is removed by filtration. The filtrate (mother liquor) contains impurities and small quantity of the compound. If the compound is highly soluble in one solvent and very little soluble in another solvent, crystallisation can be satisfactorily carried out in a mixture of these solvents. Impurities, which impart colour to the solution are removed by adsorbing over activated charcoal. Repeated crystallisation becomes necessary for the purification of compounds containing impurities of comparable solubilities. 8.8.3 Distillation This important method is used to separate (i) volatile liquids from nonvolatile impurities and (ii) the liquids having sufficient difference in their boiling points. Liquids having different boiling points vaporise at different temperatures. The vapours are cooled and the liquids so formed are collected separately. Chloroform (b.p 334 K) and aniline (b.p. 457 K) are easily separated by the technique of distillation (Fig 8.5). The liquid mixture is taken in a round bottom flask and heated carefully. On boiling, the vapours of lower boiling component are formed first. The vapours are condensed by using a condenser and the liquid is collected in a receiver.

The vapours of such liquids are formed within the same temperature range and are condensed simultaneously. The technique of fractional distillation is used in such cases. In this technique, vapours of a liquid mixture are passed through a fractionating column before condensation. The fractionating column is fitted over the mouth of the round bottom flask (Fig.8.6, page 280). Vapours of the liquid with higher boiling point condense before the vapours of the liquid with lower boiling point. The vapours rising up in the fractionating column become richer in more volatile component. By the Fig.8.5 Simple distillation.

A fractionating column provides many surfaces for heat exchange between the ascending vapours and the descending condensed liquid. Some of the condensing liquid in the fractionating column obtains heat from the ascending vapours and revaporises. The vapours thus become richer in low boiling component. The vapours of low boiling component ascend to the top of the column.

Distillation under reduced pressure: This method is used to purify liquids having very high boiling points and those, which decompose at or below their boiling points. Such liquids are made to boil at a temperature lower than their normal boiling points by reducing the pressure on their surface. A liquid boils at a temperature at which its vapour pressure is equal to the external pressure. The pressure is reduced with the help of a water pump or vacuum pump (Fig.8.8).

Steam Distillation: This technique is applied to separate substances which are steam volatile and are immiscible with water. In steam distillation, steam from a steam generator is passed through a heated flask containing the liquid to be distilled. The mixture of steam and the volatile organic compound is condensed and collected. The compound is later separated from water using a separating funnel. In steam distillation, the liquid boils when the sum of vapour pressures due to the organic liquid (p1) and that due to water (p2) becomes equal to the atmospheric pressure (p), i.e. p =p1+ p2.

The organic solvent and the aqueous solution should be immiscible with each other so that they form two distinct layers which can be separated by separatory funnel. The organic solvent is later removed by distillation or by evaporation to get back the compound. Differential extraction is carried out in a separatory funnel as shown in Fig. 8.10 (Page 282). If the organic compound is less soluble in the organic solvent, a very large quantity of solvent would be required to extract even a very small quantity of the compound. The technique of continuous extraction is employed in such cases. In this technique same solvent is repeatedly used for extraction of the compound. 8.8.5 Chromatography Chromatography is an important technique extensively used to separate mixtures into their components, purify compounds and also to test the purity of compounds. The Reprint 2025-26 282 chemistry name chromatography is based on the Greek word chroma, for colour since the method was first used for the separation of coloured substances found in plants. In this technique, the mixture of substances is applied onto a stationary phase, which may be a solid or a liquid.

Commonly used adsorbents are silica gel and alumina. When a mobile phase is allowed to move over a stationary phase (adsorbent), the components of the mixture move by varying distances over the stationary phase.

A thin layer (about 0.2mm thick) of an adsorbent (silica gel or alumina) is spread over a glass plate of suitable size. The plate is known as thin layer chromatography plate or chromaplate. The solution of the mixture to be separated is applied as a small spot about 2 cm above one end of the TLC plate. The spots of coloured compounds are visible on TLC plate due to their original colour. The spots of colourless compounds, which are invisible to the eye but fluoresce in ultraviolet light, can be detected by putting the plate under ultraviolet light. Another detection technique is to place the plate in a covered jar containing a few crystals of iodine. Spots of compounds, which adsorb iodine, will show up as brown spots. Sometimes an appropriate reagent may also be sprayed on the plate. For example, amino acids may be detected by spraying the plate with ninhydrin solution (Fig.8.12b).

The nature of the covalent bonding in organic compounds can be described in terms of orbitals hybridisation concept, according to which carbon can have sp3, sp2 and sp hybridised orbitals. The sp3, sp2 and sp hybridised carbons are found in compounds like methane, ethene and ethyne respectively. The tetrahedral shape of methane, planar shape of ethene and linear shape of ethyne can be understood on the basis of this concept. A sp3 hybrid orbital can overlap with 1s orbital of hydrogen to give a carbon - hydrogen (C\u2013H) single bond (sigma, \u03c3 bond). Overlap of a sp2 orbital of one carbon with sp2 orbital of another results in the formation of a carbon\u2013carbon \u03c3 bond. The unhybridised p orbitals on two adjacent carbons can undergo lateral (side- by-side) overlap to give a pi (\u03c0) bond. Organic compounds can be represented by various structural formulas."}

Organic compounds can be classified on the basis of their structure or the functional groups they contain. A functional group is an atom or group of atoms bonded together in a unique fashion and which determines the physical and chemical properties of the compounds. The naming of the organic compounds is carried out by following a set of rules laid down by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). In IUPAC nomenclature, the names are correlated with the structure in such a way that the reader can deduce the structure from the name. Organic reaction mechanism concepts are based on the structure of the substrate molecule, fission of a covalent bond, the attacking reagents, the electron displacement effects and the conditions of the reaction. These organic reactions involve breaking and making of covalent bonds. A covalent bond may be cleaved in heterolytic or homolytic fashion. A heterolytic cleavage yields carbocations or carbanions, while a homolytic cleavage gives free radicals as reactive intermediate. Reactions proceeding through heterolytic cleavage involve the complimentary pairs of reactive species. These are electron pair donor known as nucleophile and an electron pair acceptor known as electrophile. The inductive, resonance, electromeric and hyperconjugation effects may help in the polarisation of a bond making certain carbon atom or other atom positions as places of low or high electron densities. Organic reactions can be broadly classified into following types; substitution, addition, elimination and rearrangement reactions. Purification, qualitative and quantitative analysis of organic compounds are carried out for determining their structures. The methods of purification namely : sublimation, distillation and differential extraction are based on the difference in one or more physical properties."}

This is also a fuel and is obtained by liquifaction of natural gas. Petrol, diesel and kerosene oil are obtained by the fractional distillation of petroleum found under the earth\u2019s crust. Coal gas is obtained by the destructive distillation of coal. Natural gas is found in upper strata during drilling of oil wells. The gas after compression is known as compressed natural gas. LPG is used as a domestic fuel with the least pollution. Kerosene oil is also used as a domestic fuel but it causes some pollution. Automobiles need fuels like petrol, diesel and CNG. Petrol and CNG operated automobiles cause less pollution. All these fuels contain mixture of hydrocarbons, which are sources of energy. Hydrocarbons are also used for the manufacture of polymers like polythene, polypropene, polystyrene etc. Higher hydrocarbons are used as solvents for paints. They are also used as the starting materials for manufacture of many dyes and drugs. Thus, you can well understand the importance of hydrocarbons in your daily life. In this unit, you will learn more about hydrocarbons. 9.1 CLASSIFICATION Hydrocarbons are of different types. Depending upon the types of carbon-carbon bonds present, they can be classified into three main categories \u2013 (i) saturated Hydrocarbons are the important sources of energy. Reprint 2025-26 296 chemistry (ii) unsaturated and (iii) aromatic hydrocarbons. Saturated hydrocarbons contain carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen single bonds. If different carbon atoms are joined together to form open chain of carbon atoms with single bonds, they are termed as alkanes as you have already studied in Unit 8. On the other hand, if carbon atoms form a closed chain or a ring, they are termed as cycloalkanes. Unsaturated hydrocarbons contain carbon-carbon multiple bonds \u2013 double bonds, triple bonds or both."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 94, "content": "Aromatic hydrocarbons are a special type of cyclic compounds. You can construct a large number of models of such molecules of both types (open chain and close chain) keeping in mind that carbon is tetravalent and hydrogen is monovalent. For making models of alkanes, you can use toothpicks for bonds and plasticine balls for atoms. For alkenes, alkynes and aromatic hydrocarbons, spring models can be constructed. 9.2 ALKANES As already mentioned, alkanes are saturated open chain hydrocarbons containing carbon - carbon single bonds. Methane (CH4) is the first member of this family. Methane is a gas found in coal mines and marshy places. If you replace one hydrogen atom of methane by carbon and join the required number of hydrogens to satisfy the tetravalence of the other carbon atom, what do you get? You get C2H6. This hydrocarbon with molecular formula C2H6 is known as ethane. Thus you can consider C2H6 as derived from CH4 by replacing one hydrogen atom by -CH3 group. Go on constructing alkanes by doing this theoretical exercise i.e., replacing hydrogen atom by \u2013CH3 group. The next molecules will be C3H8, C4H10 \u2026 of the general formula for alkane family or homologous series? If we examine the formula of different alkanes we find that the general formula for alkanes is CnH2n+2. It represents any particular homologue when n is given appropriate value. Can you recall the structure of methane? According to VSEPR theory (Unit 4), methane has a tetrahedral structure (Fig. 9.1), in which carbon atom lies at the centre and the four hydrogen atoms lie at the four corners of a regular tetrahedron. All H-C-H bond angles are of 109.5\u00b0. In alkanes, tetrahedra are joined together in which C-C and C-H bond lengths are 154 pm and 112 pm respectively (Unit 8)."}

Can you think Reprint 2025-26 297 Hydrocarbons In how many ways, you can join five carbon atoms and twelve hydrogen atoms of C5H12? They can be arranged in three ways as shown in structures III\u2013V isomers. It is also clear that structures I and III have continuous chain of carbon atoms but structures II, IV and V have a branched chain.

Why? 9.2.3 Properties Physical properties Alkanes are almost non-polar molecules because of the covalent nature of C-C and C-H bonds and due to very little difference of electronegativity between carbon and hydrogen atoms. They possess weak van der Waals forces. Due to the weak forces, the first four members, C1 to C4 are gases, C5 to C17 are liquids and those containing 18 carbon atoms or more are solids at 298 K. They are colourless and odourless. What do you think about solubility of alkanes in water based upon non-polar nature of alkanes? Petrol is a mixture of hydrocarbons and is used as a fuel for automobiles. Petrol and lower fractions of petroleum are also used for dry cleaning of clothes to remove grease stains. On the basis of this observation, what do you think about the nature of the greasy substance? You are correct if you say that grease (mixture of higher alkanes) is non- Reprint 2025-26 302 chemistry polar and, hence, hydrophobic in nature. It is generally observed that in relation to solubility of substances in solvents, polar substances are soluble in polar solvents, whereas the non-polar ones in non-polar solvents i.e., like dissolves like. Boiling point (b.p.) of different alkanes are given in Table 9.2 from which it is clear that there is a steady increase in boiling point with increase in molecular mass. This is due to the fact that the intermolecular van der Waals forces increase with increase of the molecular size or the surface area of the molecule."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 103, "content": "You can make an interesting observation by having a look on the boiling points of three isomeric pentanes viz., (pentane, 2-methylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpropane). It is observed (Table 9.2) that pentane having a continuous chain of five carbon atoms has the highest boiling point (309.1K) whereas 2,2 \u2013 dimethylpropane boils at 282.5K. With increase in number of branched chains, the molecule attains the shape of a sphere. This results in smaller area of contact and therefore weak intermolecular forces between spherical molecules, which are overcome at relatively lower temperatures. Chemical properties As already mentioned, alkanes are generally inert towards acids, bases, oxidising and reducing agents. However, they undergo the following reactions under certain conditions. 1. Substitution reactions One or more hydrogen atoms of alkanes can be replaced by halogens, nitro group and sulphonic acid group. Halogenation takes place either at higher temperature (573-773 K) or in the presence of diffused sunlight or ultraviolet light. Lower alkanes do not undergo nitration and sulphonation reactions.

Electron distribution of the sigma molecular orbital is symmetrical around the internuclear axis of the C\u2013C bond which is not disturbed due to rotation about its axis. This permits free rotation about C\u2013C single bond. This rotation results into different spatial arrangements of atoms in space which can change into one another. Such spatial arrangements of atoms which can be converted into one another by rotation around a C-C single bond are called conformations or conformers or rotamers."}

However, it may be remembered that rotation around a C-C single bond is not completely free. It is hindered by a small energy barrier of 1-20 kJ mol \u20131 due to weak repulsive interaction between the adjacent bonds. Such a type of repulsive interaction is called torsional strain. Conformations of ethane : Ethane molecule (C2H6) contains a carbon \u2013 carbon single bond with each carbon atom attached to three hydrogen atoms. Considering the ball and stick model of ethane, keep one carbon atom stationary and rotate the other carbon atom around the C-C axis. This rotation results into infinite number of spatial arrangements of hydrogen atoms attached to one carbon atom with respect to the hydrogen atoms attached to the other carbon atom. These are called conformational isomers (conformers). Thus there are infinite number of conformations of ethane. However, there are two extreme cases. One such conformation in which hydrogen atoms attached to two carbons are as closed together as possible is called eclipsed conformation and the other in which hydrogens are as far apart as possible is known as the staggered conformation. Any other intermediate conformation is called a skew conformation.It may be remembered that in all the conformations, the bond angles and the bond lengths remain the same. Eclipsed and the staggered conformations can be represented by Sawhorse and Newman projections. 1. Sawhorse projections In this projection, the molecule is viewed along the molecular axis. It is then projected on paper by drawing the central C\u2013C bond as a somewhat longer straight line. Upper end of the line is slightly tilted towards right or left hand side."}

Thus, there are minimum repulsive forces, minimum energy and maximum stability of the molecule. On the other hand, when the staggered form changes into the eclipsed form, the electron clouds of the carbon \u2013 hydrogen bonds come closer to each other resulting in increase in electron cloud repulsions. To check the increased repulsive forces, molecule will have to possess more energy and thus has lesser stability. As already mentioned, the repulsive interaction between the electron clouds, which affects stability of a conformation, is called torsional strain."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 110, "content": "Magnitude of torsional strain depends upon the angle of rotation about C\u2013C bond. This angle is also called dihedral angle or torsional angle. Of all the conformations of ethane, the staggered form has the least torsional strain and the eclipsed form, the maximum torsional strain. Therefore, staggered conformation is more stable than the eclipsed conformation. Hence, molecule largely remains in staggered conformation or we can say that it is preferred conformation. Thus it may be inferred that rotation around C\u2013C bond in ethane is not completely free. The energy difference between the two extreme forms is of the order of 12.5 kJ mol \u20131, which is very small. Even at ordinary temperatures, the ethane molecule gains thermal or kinetic energy sufficient enough to overcome this energy barrier of 12.5 kJ mol \u20131 through intermolecular collisions. Thus, it can be said that rotation about carbon-carbon single bond in ethane is almost free for all practical purposes. It has not been possible to separate and isolate different conformational isomers of ethane. 9.3 Alkenes Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing at least one double bond. What should be the general formula of alkenes? If there is one double bond between two carbon atoms in alkenes, they must possess two hydrogen atoms less than alkanes. Hence, general formula for alkenes is CnH2n. Alkenes are also known as olefins (oil forming) since the first member, ethylene or ethene (C2H4) was found to form an oily liquid on reaction with chlorine."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 111, "content": "9.3.1 Structure of Double Bond Carbon-carbon double bond in alkenes consists of one strong sigma (\u03c3) bond (bond enthalpy about 397 kJ mol \u20131) due to head-on overlapping of sp 2 hybridised orbitals and one weak pi (\u03c0) bond (bond enthalpy about 284 kJ mol \u20131) obtained by lateral or sideways overlapping of the two 2p orbitals of the two carbon atoms. The double bond is shorter in bond length (134 pm) than the C\u2013C single bond (154 pm). You have already read that the pi (\u03c0) bond is a weaker bond due to poor sideways overlapping between the two 2p orbitals. Thus, the presence of the pi (\u03c0) bond makes alkenes behave as sources of loosely held mobile electrons. Therefore, alkenes are easily attacked by reagents or compounds which are in search of electrons. Such reagents are called electrophilic reagents. The presence of weaker \u03c0-bond makes alkenes unstable molecules in comparison to alkanes and thus, alkenes can be changed into single bond compounds by combining with the electrophilic reagents. Strength of the double bond (bond enthalpy, 681 kJ mol \u20131) is greater than that of a carbon-carbon single bond in ethane (bond enthalpy, 348 kJ mol \u20131). Orbital diagrams of ethene molecule are shown in Figs. 9.4 and 9.5. 9.3.2 Nomenclature For nomenclature of alkenes in IUPAC system, the longest chain of carbon atoms containing the double bond is selected.

This results in different geometry of (a) and (b) i.e. disposition of atoms or groups in space in the two arrangements is different. Therefore, they are stereoisomers. They would have the same geometry if atoms or groups around C=C bond can be rotated but rotation around C=C bond is not free. It is restricted.

There are cases when under special conditions, alkenes also undergo free radical substitution reactions. Oxidation and ozonolysis reactions are also quite prominent in alkenes.

Addition of halogens : Halogens like bromine or chlorine add up to alkene to form vicinal dihalides. However, iodine does not show addition reaction under Reprint 2025-26 311 Hydrocarbons normal conditions.

Each carbon atom of ethyne has two sp hybridised orbitals. Carbon-carbon sigma (\u03c3) bond is obtained by the head-on overlapping of the two sp hybridised orbitals of the two carbon atoms. The remaining sp hybridised orbital of each carbon atom undergoes overlapping along the internuclear axis with the 1s orbital of each of the two hydrogen atoms forming two C-H sigma bonds. H-C-C bond angle is of 180\u00b0. Each carbon has two unhybridised p orbitals which are perpendicular to each other as well as to the plane of the C-C sigma bond. The 2p orbitals of one carbon atom are parallel to the 2p orbitals of the other carbon atom, which undergo lateral or sideways overlapping to form two pi (\u03c0) bonds between two carbon atoms. Thus ethyne molecule consists of one C\u2013C \u03c3 bond, two C\u2013H \u03c3 bonds and two C\u2013C \u03c0 bonds. The strength of C\u2261C bond (bond enthalpy 823 kJ mol -1) is more than those of C=C bond (bond enthalpy 681 kJ mol \u20131) and C\u2013C bond (bond enthalpy 348 kJ mol \u20131).

First three members are gases, the next eight are liquids and the higher ones are solids. All alkynes are colourless. Ethyene has characteristic odour. Other members are odourless. Alkynes are weakly polar in nature. They are lighter than water and immiscible with water but soluble in organic solvents like ethers, carbon tetrachloride and benzene. Their melting point, boiling point and density increase with increase in molar mass. Chemical properties Alkynes show acidic nature, addition reactions and polymerisation reactions as follows : A. Acidic character of alkyne: Sodium metal and sodamide (NaNH2) are strong bases. They react with ethyne to form sodium acetylide with the liberation of dihydrogen gas. These reactions have not been observed in case of ethene and ethane thus indicating that ethyne is acidic in nature in comparison to ethene and ethane. Why is it so ? Has it something to do with their structures and the hybridisation ?

Thus in ethyne, hydrogen atoms can be liberated as protons more easily as compared to ethene and ethane. Hence, hydrogen atoms of ethyne attached to triply bonded carbon atom are acidic in nature.

Benzene was further found to produce one and only one monosubstituted derivative which indicated that all the six carbon and six hydrogen atoms of benzene are identical.

Two types of behaviour are observed. Either ortho and para products or meta product is predominantly formed. It has also been observed that this behaviour depends on the nature of the substituent already present in the benzene ring and not on the nature of the entering group. This is known as directive influence of substituents. Reasons for ortho/para or meta directive nature of groups are discussed below: Ortho and para directing groups: The groups which direct the incoming group to ortho and para positions are called ortho and para directing groups."}
{"source": "chemistry_class_11_2.pdf", "chunk_id": 134, "content": "As an example, let us discuss the directive influence of phenolic (\u2013OH) group. Phenol is resonance hybrid of following structures: It is clear from the above resonating structures that the electron density is more on o \u2013 and p \u2013 positions. Hence, the substitution takes place mainly at these positions. However, it may be noted that \u2013I effect of \u2013 OH group also operates due to which the electron density on ortho and para positions of the benzene ring is slightly reduced. But the overall electron density increases at these positions of the ring due to resonance. Therefore, \u2013OH group activates the benzene ring for the attack by Reprint 2025-26 325 Hydrocarbons an electrophile. Other examples of activating groups are \u2013NH2, \u2013NHR, \u2013NHCOCH3, \u2013OCH3, \u2013CH3, \u2013C2H5, etc. In the case of aryl halides, halogens are moderately deactivating. Because of their strong \u2013 I effect, overall electron density on benzene ring decreases. It makes further substitution difficult. However, due to resonance the electron density on o\u2013 and p\u2013 positions is greater than that at the m-position. Hence, they are also o\u2013 and p \u2013 directing groups. Resonance structures of chlorobenzene are given below: In this case, the overall electron density on benzene ring decreases making further substitution difficult, therefore these groups are also called \u2018deactivating groups\u2019. The electron density on o \u2013 and p \u2013 position is comparatively less than that at meta position. Hence, the electrophile attacks on comparatively electron rich meta position resulting in meta substitution. 9.6 Carcinogenicity and Toxicity Benzene and polynuclear hydrocarbons containing more than two benzene rings fused together are toxic and said to possess cancer producing (carcinogenic) property. Such polynuclear hydrocarbons are formed on incomplete combustion of organic materials like tobacco, coal and petroleum."}

Some of the carcinogenic hydrocarbons are given below (see box). Meta directing group: The groups which direct the incoming group to meta position are called meta directing groups. Some examples of meta directing groups are \u2013NO2, \u2013CN, \u2013CHO, \u2013COR, \u2013COOH, \u2013COOR, \u2013SO3H, etc. Let us take the example of nitro group. Nitro group reduces the electron density in the benzene ring due to its strong\u2013I effect. Nitrobenzene is a resonance hybrid of the following structures. Reprint 2025-26 326 chemistry SUMMARY Hydrocarbons are the compounds of carbon and hydrogen only. Hydrocarbons are mainly obtained from coal and petroleum, which are the major sources of energy. Petrochemicals are the prominent starting materials used for the manufacture of a large number of commercially important products. LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and CNG (compressed natural gas), the main sources of energy for domestic fuels and the automobile industry, are obtained from petroleum. Hydrocarbons are classified as open chain saturated (alkanes) and unsaturated (alkenes and alkynes), cyclic (alicyclic) and aromatic, according to their structure. The important reactions of alkanes are free radical substitution, combustion, oxidation and aromatization. Alkenes and alkynes undergo addition reactions, which are mainly electrophilic additions. Aromatic hydrocarbons, despite having unsaturation, undergo mainly electrophilic substitution reactions. These undergo addition reactions only under special conditions. Alkanes show conformational isomerism due to free rotation along the C\u2013C sigma bonds. Out of staggered and the eclipsed conformations of ethane, staggered conformation is more stable as hydrogen atoms are farthest apart. Alkenes exhibit geometrical (cis-trans) isomerism due to restricted rotation around the carbon\u2013carbon double bond. Benzene and benzenoid compounds show aromatic character."}
