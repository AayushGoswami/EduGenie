We\ncan also see as we look around that all the\nthings mentioned above occupy space and\nhave mass. In other words, they have both\nmass* and volume**.

Early Indian philosophers classified matter in\nthe form of five basic elements \u2014 the \u201cPanch\nTatva\u201d \u2014 air, earth, fire, sky and water. According to them everything, living or non-\nliving, was made up of these five basic\nelements. Ancient Greek philosophers had\narrived at a similar classification of matter. Modern day scientists have evolved two\ntypes of classification of matter based on their\nphysical properties and chemical nature. In this chapter we shall learn about\nmatter based on its physical properties. Chemical aspects of matter will be taken up\nin subsequent chapters. 1.1  Physical Nature of Matter\n1.1.1 MATTER IS MADE UP OF PARTICLES\nFor a long time, two schools of thought prevailed\nregarding the nature of matter. One school\nbelieved matter to be continuous like a block\nof wood, whereas, the other thought that matter\nwas made up of particles like sand.

{"source": "science_class_9.pdf", "chunk_id": 5, "content": "We can see that\nmatter around us exists in three different\nstates\u2013 solid, liquid and gas. These states of\nmatter arise due to the variation in the\ncharacteristics of the particles of matter. Now, let us study about the properties of\nthese three states of matter in detail. 1.3.1 THE SOLID STATE\nActivity _____________  1.9\n\u2022\nCollect the following articles \u2014 a pen,\na book, a needle and a piece of wooden\nstick. \u2022\nSketch the shape of the above articles\nin your notebook by moving a pencil\naround them. \u2022\nDo all these have a definite shape,\ndistinct boundaries and a fixed volume? \u2022\nWhat happens if they are hammered,\npulled or dropped? \u2022\nAre these capable of diffusing into each\nother? \u2022\nTry compressing them by applying\nforce. Are you able to compress them? All the above are examples of solids. We\ncan observe that all these have a definite\nshape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes,\nthat is, have negligible compressibility. Solids\nhave a tendency to maintain their shape when\nsubjected to outside force. Solids may break\nunder force but it is difficult to change their\nshape, so they are rigid. Consider the following:\n(a) What about a rubber band, can it\nchange its shape on stretching? Is it\na solid? (b) What about sugar and salt? When\nkept in different jars these take the\nshape of the jar. Are they solid? (c) What about a sponge? It is a solid\nyet we are able to compress it. Why? All the above are solids as:\n\u2022\nA rubber band changes shape under\nforce and regains the same shape when\nthe force is removed. If excessive force is\napplied, it breaks."}

(b) containers of different shapes. Put\na 50 mL mark on these containers\nusing a measuring cylinder from\nthe laboratory. \u2022\nWhat will happen if these liquids are\nspilt on the floor? \u2022\nMeasure 50 mL of any one liquid and\ntransfer it into different containers one\nby one. Does the volume remain the\nsame? \u2022\nDoes the shape of the liquid remain the\nsame ? \u2022\nWhen you pour the liquid from one\ncontainer into another, does it flow\neasily? We observe that liquids have no fixed\nshape but have a fixed volume. They take up\nthe shape of the container in which they are\nkept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they\nare not rigid but can be called fluid. Refer  to activities 1.4 and 1.5 where we\nsaw that solids and liquids can diffuse into\nliquids. The gases from the atmosphere\ndiffuse and dissolve in water. These gases,\nespecially oxygen and carbon dioxide, are\nessential for the survival of aquatic animals\nand plants. All living creatures need to breathe for\nsurvival. The aquatic animals can breathe\nunder water due to the presence of dissolved\noxygen  in water. Thus, we may conclude that\nsolids, liquids and gases can diffuse into\nliquids. The rate of diffusion of liquids is\nReprint 2025-26\nMATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS\n5\nhigher than that of solids."}

We need answers to these questions,\nisn\u2019t it?

On increasing the temperature of solids,\nthe kinetic energy of the particles increases. Due to the increase in kinetic energy, the\nparticles start vibrating with greater speed. The energy supplied by heat overcomes the\nforces of attraction between the particles. The\nparticles leave their fixed positions and start\nmoving more freely."}
{"source": "science_class_9.pdf", "chunk_id": 10, "content": "A stage is reached when\nthe solid melts and is converted to a liquid. The minimum temperature at which a solid\nmelts to become a liquid at the atmospheric\npressure is called its melting point. The melting point of a solid is an indication\nof the strength of the force of attraction\nbetween its particles. The melting point of ice is 273.15 K*. The\nprocess of melting, that is, change of solid\nstate into liquid state is also known as fusion. When a solid melts, its temperature\nremains the same, so where does the heat\nenergy go? You must have observed, during the\nexperiment of melting, that the temperature\nof the system does not change after the\nmelting point is reached, till all the ice melts. This happens even though we continue to\nheat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply\nheat. This heat gets used up in changing the\nstate by overcoming the forces of attraction\nbetween the particles. As this heat energy is\nabsorbed by ice without showing any rise in\ntemperature, it is considered that it gets\nhidden into the contents of the beaker and is\nknown as the latent heat. The word latent\nmeans hidden. The amount of heat energy\nthat is required to change 1 kg of a solid into\nliquid at atmospheric pressure at its melting\npoint is known as the latent heat of fusion. So, particles in water at 0oC (273 K) have more\nenergy as compared to particles in ice at the\nsame temperature. When we supply heat energy to water,\nparticles start moving even faster. At a certain\ntemperature, a point is reached when the\nparticles have enough energy to break free\nfrom the forces of attraction of each other. At\nthis temperature the liquid starts changing\ninto gas."}
{"source": "science_class_9.pdf", "chunk_id": 11, "content": "The temperature at which a liquid\nstarts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is\nknown as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk\nphenomenon. Particles from the bulk of the\nliquid gain enough energy to change into the\nvapour state. For water this temperature is 373 K\n(100oC = 273 + 100 = 373 K). Can you define the latent heat of\nvaporisation? Do it in the same way as we\nhave defined the latent heat of fusion. Particles in steam, that is, water vapour at\n373 K (1000 C) have more energy than water\nat the same temperature. This is because\nparticles in steam have absorbed extra energy\nin the form of latent heat of vaporisation. *Note: Kelvin is the SI unit of temperature, 0o C =273.15 K. For convenience, we take 0o C = 273 K after\nrounding off the decimal. To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale you\nhave to subtract 273 from the given temperature, and to convert a temperature on the Celsius\nscale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature. So, we infer that the state of matter can\nbe changed into another state by changing\nthe temperature.

For example, milk is\nactually a mixture of water, fat, proteins, etc. When a scientist says that something is pure,\nit means that all the constituent particles of\nthat substance are the same in their chemical\nnature. A pure substance consists of a single\ntype of particle. In other words, a substance is\na pure single form of matter. As we look around, we can see that most\nof the matter around us exists as mixtures of\ntwo or more pure components, for example,\nsea water, minerals, soil, etc., are all mixtures. 2.1 What is a Mixture? Mixtures  are constituted by more than one\nkind of pure form of matter. We know that\ndissolved sodium chloride can be separated\nfrom water by the physical process of\nevaporation. However, sodium chloride is itself\na pure substance and cannot be separated by\nphysical process into its chemical constituents. Similarly, sugar is a substance which contains\nonly one kind of pure matter and its\ncomposition is the same throughout. Soft drink and soil are not single pure\nsubstances.

So,\nwe understand that in a solution the relative\nproportion of the solute and solvent can be\nvaried.

The mixture obtained by group D in activity\n2.2 is called a colloid or a colloidal solution. The particles of a colloid are uniformly spread\nthroughout the solution.

Metals usually show some or all of the\nfollowing properties:\n\u2022\nThey have a lustre (shine). \u2022\nThey have silvery-grey or golden-yellow\ncolour. \u2022\nThey conduct heat and electricity. \u2022\nThey are ductile (can be drawn into\nwires). \u2022\nThey are malleable (can be hammered\ninto thin sheets). \u2022\nThey are sonorous (make a ringing\nsound when hit). Examples of metals are gold, silver,\ncopper, iron, sodium, potassium etc. Mercury\nis the only metal that is liquid at room\ntemperature. Non-metals usually show some or all of the\nfollowing properties:\n\u2022\nThey display a variety of colours. \u2022\nThey are poor conductors of heat and\nelectricity."}

{"source": "science_class_9.pdf", "chunk_id": 33, "content": "The idea of divisibility\nof matter was considered long back in India,\naround 500 BC. An Indian philosopher\nMaharishi Kanad, postulated that if we go on\ndividing matter (padarth), we shall get smaller\nand smaller particles. Ultimately, a stage will\ncome when we shall come across the smallest\nparticles beyond which further division will\nnot be possible. He named these particles\nParmanu. Another Indian philosopher,\nPakudha Katyayama, elaborated this doctrine\nand said that these particles normally exist\nin a combined form which gives us various\nforms of matter. Around the same era, ancient Greek\nphilosophers \u2013 Democritus and Leucippus\nsuggested that if we go on dividing matter, a\nstage will come when particles obtained\ncannot be divided further. Democritus called\nthese indivisible particles atoms (meaning\nindivisible).

By the end of the eighteenth century,\nscientists recognised the difference between\nelements and compounds and naturally\nbecame interested in finding out how and why\nelements combine and what happens when\nthey combine.

In a compound such as water, the ratio of\nthe mass of hydrogen to the mass of oxygen is\nalways 1:8, whatever the source of water. Thus,\nif 9 g of water is decomposed, 1 g of hydrogen\nand 8 g of oxygen are always obtained. Similarly in ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen\nare always present in the ratio 14:3 by mass,\nwhatever the method or the source from which\nit is obtained."}

This law was stated by Proust as\n\u201cIn a chemical substance the elements are\nalways present in definite proportions by\nmass\u201d. The next problem faced by scientists was\nto give appropriate explanations of these laws. British chemist John Dalton provided the\nbasic theory about the nature of matter. Dalton picked up the idea of divisibility of\nmatter, which was till then just a philosophy. He took the name \u2018atoms\u2019 as given by the\nGreeks and said that the smallest particles of\nmatter are atoms. His theory was based on the\nlaws of chemical combination. Dalton\u2019s atomic\ntheory provided an explanation for the law of\nconservation of mass and the law of\ndefinite proportions. John Dalton was born in\na poor weaver\u2019s family in\n1766 in England. He\nbegan his career as a\nteacher at the age of\ntwelve. Seven years later\nhe became a school\nprincipal. In 1793, Dalton\nleft for Manchester to\nteach \nmathematics,\nphysics and chemistry in\na college. He spent most of his life there\nteaching and researching. In 1808, he\npresented his atomic theory which was a\nturning point in the study of matter. According to Dalton\u2019s atomic theory, all\nmatter, whether an element, a compound or\na mixture is composed of small particles called\natoms. The postulates of this theory may be\nstated as follows:\n(i)\nAll matter is made of very tiny particles\ncalled atoms, which participate in\nchemical reactions. (ii)\nAtoms are indivisible particles, which\ncannot be created or destroyed in a\nchemical reaction. (iii)\nAtoms of a given element are identical\nin mass and chemical properties.

Now-a-days, IUPAC (International Union of\nPure and Applied Chemistry) is an\ninternational scientific organisation which\napproves names of elements, symbols and\nunits. Many of the symbols are the first one\nor two letters of the element\u2019s name in\nEnglish. The first letter of a symbol is always\nwritten as a capital letter (uppercase) and the\nsecond letter as a small letter (lowercase)."}

Examples are: (i)\nchlorine, Cl, (ii) zinc, Zn etc. Other symbols have been taken from the\nnames of elements in Latin, German or Greek. For example, the symbol of iron is Fe from its\nLatin name ferrum, sodium is Na from natrium,\npotassium is K from kalium. Therefore, each\nelement has a name and a unique\nchemical symbol.

According to him, each element had a\ncharacteristic atomic mass. The theory could\nexplain the law of constant proportions so well\nthat scientists were prompted to measure the\natomic mass of an atom. Since determining the\nmass of an individual atom was a relatively\ndifficult task, relative atomic masses were\ndetermined using the laws of chemical\ncombinations and the compounds formed. Let us take the example of a compound,\ncarbon monoxide (CO) formed by carbon and\noxygen. It was observed experimentally that 3\ng of carbon combines with 4 g of oxygen to\nform CO. In other words, carbon combines\nwith 4/3 times its mass of oxygen."}

This was\nconsidered relevant due to two reasons:\n\u2022\noxygen reacted with a large number of\nelements and formed compounds. \u2022\nthis atomic mass unit gave masses of\nmost of the elements as whole numbers. However, in 1961 for a universally\naccepted atomic mass unit, carbon-12 isotope\nwas chosen as the standard reference for\nmeasuring atomic masses. One atomic mass\nunit is a mass unit equal to exactly one-twelfth\n(1/12th) the mass of one atom of carbon-12. The relative atomic masses of all elements\nhave been found with respect to an atom of\ncarbon-12. Imagine a fruit seller selling fruits without\nany standard weight with him.

Does the comb then\nattract small pieces of paper? B. Rub a glass rod with a silk cloth and\nbring the rod near an inflated balloon. Observe what happens. From these activities, can we conclude\nthat on rubbing two objects together, they\nbecome electrically charged? Where does this\ncharge come from? This question can be\nanswered by knowing that an atom is divisible\nand consists of charged particles. Many scientists contributed in revealing\nthe presence of charged particles in an atom. It was known by 1900 that the atom was\nindivisible particle but contained at least one\nsub-atomic particle \u2013 the electron identified by\nJ.J. Thomson. Even before the electron was\nidentified, E. Goldstein in 1886 discovered the\npresence of new radiations  in a gas discharge\nand called them canal rays. These rays were\npositively charged radiations which ultimately\nled to the discovery of another sub-atomic\nparticle. This sub-atomic particle had a charge,\nequal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that\nof the electron. Its mass was approximately\n2000 times as that of the electron. It was given\nthe name of proton. In general, an electron is\nrepresented as \u2018e\u2013\u2019 and a proton as \u2018p+\u2019. The\nmass of a proton is taken as one unit and its\ncharge as plus one. The mass of an electron is\nconsidered to be negligible and its charge is\nminus one.

But the\ndiscovery of two fundamental particles\n(electrons and protons) inside the atom, led\nto the failure of this aspect of Dalton\u2019s atomic\ntheory. It was then considered necessary to\nknow how electrons and protons are arranged\nwithin an atom. For explaining this, many\nscientists proposed various atomic models. J.J. Thomson was the first one to propose a\nmodel for the structure of an atom. 4.2.1 THOMSON\u2019S MODEL OF AN ATOM\nThomson proposed the model of an atom to\nbe similar to that of a Christmas pudding. The electrons, in a sphere of positive charge,\nwere like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical\nChristmas pudding. We can also think of a\nwatermelon, the positive charge in the atom\nis spread all over like the red edible part of\nthe watermelon, while the electrons are\nstudded in the positively charged sphere, like\nthe seeds in the watermelon (Fig. 4.1). Thomson proposed that:\n(i)\nAn atom consists of a positively\ncharged sphere and the electrons are\nembedded in it."}
{"source": "science_class_9.pdf", "chunk_id": 51, "content": "(ii)\nThe negative and positive charges are\nequal in magnitude. So, the atom as a\nwhole is electrically neutral. Although Thomson\u2019s model explained that\natoms are electrically neutral, the results of\nexperiments carried out by other scientists\ncould not be explained by this model, as we\nwill see below. 4.2.2 RUTHERFORD\u2019S MODEL OF AN ATOM\nErnest Rutherford was interested in knowing\nhow the electrons are arranged within an\natom. Rutherford designed an experiment for\nthis. In this experiment, fast moving alpha\n(\u03b1)-particles were made to fall on a thin\ngold foil. \u2022\nHe selected a gold foil because he wanted\nas thin a layer as possible. This gold foil\nwas about 1000 atoms thick. \u2022\n\u03b1-particles are doubly-charged helium\nions. Since they have a mass of 4 u, the\nfast-moving \n\u03b1-particles \nhave \na\nconsiderable amount of energy. \u2022\nIt was expected that \u03b1-particles would be\ndeflected by the sub-atomic particles in\nthe gold atoms. Since the \u03b1-particles were\nmuch heavier than the protons, he did\nnot expect to see large deflections. Q\nFig.4.1: Thomson\u2019s model of an atom\nJ.J. Thomson (1856\u2013\n1940), \n \na \nBritish\nphysicist, was born in\nCheetham Hill, a suburb\nof \nManchester, \non\n18 December 1856. He\nwas awarded the Nobel\nprize in Physics in 1906\nfor his work on the\ndiscovery of electrons.

In the words of Rutherford, \u201cThis result\nwas almost as incredible as if you fire a\n15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it\ncomes back and hits you\u201d. He will hear a sound when each stone strikes\nthe wall. If he repeats this ten times, he will\nhear the sound ten times. But if a blind-folded\nchild were to throw stones at a barbed-wire\nfence, most of the stones would not hit the\nfencing and no sound would be heard. This is\nbecause there are lots of gaps in the fence\nwhich allow the stone to pass through them. Following a similar reasoning, Rutherford\nconcluded from the \u03b1-particle scattering\nexperiment that\u2014\n(i)\nMost of the space inside the atom is\nempty because most of the \u03b1-particles\npassed through the gold foil without\ngetting deflected.

(iii)\nA very small fraction of \u03b1-particles\nwere deflected by 1800, indicating that\nall the positive charge and mass of the\ngold atom were concentrated in a very\nsmall volume within the atom. From the data he also calculated that the\nradius of the nucleus is about 105 times less\nthan the radius of the atom. On the basis of his experiment,\nRutherford put forward the nuclear model of\nan atom, which had the following features:\n(i)\nThere is a positively charged centre in\nan atom called the nucleus. Nearly all\nthe mass of an atom resides in the\nnucleus. (ii)\nThe electrons revolve around the\nnucleus in circular paths.

The combining capacity of the atoms of\nelements, that is, their tendency to react and\nform molecules with atoms of the same or\ndifferent elements, was thus explained as an\nattempt to attain a fully-filled outermost shell.

It is the number of\nprotons of an atom, which determines its\natomic number. It is denoted by \u2018Z\u2019. All atoms\nof an element have the same atomic number,\nZ. In fact, elements are defined by the number\nof protons they possess. For hydrogen, Z = 1,\nbecause in hydrogen atom, only one proton\nis present in the nucleus. Similarly, for\ncarbon, Z = 6. Therefore, the atomic number\nis defined as the total number of protons\npresent in the nucleus of an atom. 4.5.2 MASS NUMBER\nAfter studying the properties of the sub-\natomic particles of an atom, we can conclude\nthat mass of an atom is practically due to\nprotons and neutrons alone. These are\npresent in the nucleus of an atom. Hence\nprotons and neutrons are also called\nnucleons. Therefore, the mass of an atom\nresides in its nucleus. For example, mass of\ncarbon is 12 u because it has 6 protons and\n6 neutrons, 6 u + 6 u = 12 u. Similarly, the\nmass of aluminium is 27 u (13 protons+14\nneutrons). The mass number is defined as the\nsum of the total number of protons and\nneutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. It\nis denoted by \u2018A\u2019. In the notation for an atom,\nthe atomic number, mass number and symbol\nof the element are to be written as:\nMass Number\nQ\nSymbol of\nelement\nAtomic Number\nFor example, nitrogen is written as 14\n7 N . uestions\n1."}

For example, take the case of\nhydrogen atom, it has three atomic species,\nnamely protium (1\n1H), deuterium ( 2\n1 H or D)\nand tritium ( 3\n1H or T). The atomic number of\neach one is 1, but the mass number is 1, 2\nand 3, respectively. Other such examples are\n(i) carbon, \n12\n6 C and \n14\n6 C, (ii) chlorine,  35\n17 Cl\nand  37\n17 Cl, etc. On the basis of these examples, isotopes\nare defined as the atoms of the same element,\nhaving the same atomic number but different\nmass numbers. Therefore, we can say that\nthere are three isotopes of hydrogen atom,\nnamely protium, deuterium and tritium. Q\nX\nA\nZ\nReprint 2025-26\nSTRUCTURE OF THE ATOM\n45\nQ\nMany elements consist of a mixture of\nisotopes. Each isotope of an element is a pure\nsubstance. The chemical properties of\nisotopes are similar but their physical\nproperties are different. Chlorine occurs in nature in two isotopic\nforms, with masses 35 u and 37 u in the ratio\nof 3:1. Obviously, the question arises: what\nshould we take as the mass of chlorine atom? Let us find out."}

If an element\nhas no isotopes, then the mass of its atom\nwould be the same as the sum of protons and\nneutrons in it. But if an element occurs in\nisotopic forms, then we have to know the\npercentage of each isotopic form and then the\naverage mass is calculated. This does not mean that any one atom of\nchlorine has a fractional mass of 35.5 u. It\nmeans that if you take a certain amount of\nchlorine, it will contain both isotopes of\nchlorine and the average mass is 35.5 u. Applications\nSince the chemical properties of all the\nisotopes of an element are the same,\nnormally we are not concerned about\ntaking a mixture. But some isotopes have\nspecial properties which find them useful\nin various fields. Some of them are :\n(i)\nAn isotope of uranium is used as a fuel\nin nuclear reactors. (ii)\nAn isotope of cobalt is used in the\ntreatment of cancer.

If we study a cell under a microscope, we\nwould come across three features in almost\nevery cell; plasma membrane, nucleus and\ncytoplasm. All activities inside the cell and\ninteractions of the cell with its environment\nare possible due to these features. Let us see\nhow. 5.2.1 PLASMA MEMBRANE OR CELL\nMEMBRANE\nThis is the outermost covering of the cell that\nseparates the contents of the cell from its\nexternal environment. The plasma membrane\nallows or permits the entry and exit of some\nmaterials in and out of the cell. It also\nprevents movement of some other materials. The cell membrane, therefore, is called a\nselectively permeable membrane. How does the movement of substances\ntake place into the cell? How do substances\nmove out of the cell? Some substances like carbon dioxide or\noxygen can move across the cell membrane\nby a process called diffusion. We have studied\nthe process of diffusion in earlier chapters. We saw that there is spontaneous movement\nof a substance from a region of high\nconcentration to a region where its\nconcentration is low. Something similar to this happens in cells\nwhen, for example, some substance like CO2\n(which is cellular waste and requires to be\nexcreted out by the cell) accumulates in high\nconcentrations inside the cell. In the cell\u2019s\nexternal environment, the concentration of\nCO2 is low as compared to that inside the\ncell. As soon as there is a difference of\nconcentration of CO2 inside and outside a cell,\nCO2 moves out of the cell, from a region of\nhigh concentration, to a region of low\nconcentration outside the cell by the process\nof diffusion."}
{"source": "science_class_9.pdf", "chunk_id": 69, "content": "Similarly, O2 enters the cell by\nthe process of diffusion when the level or\nconcentration of O2 inside the cell decreases. Thus, diffusion plays an important role in\ngaseous exchange between the cells as well\nas the cell and its external environment. Water also obeys the law of diffusion. The\nmovement of water molecules through such a\nselectively permeable membrane is called osmosis. Q\nReprint 2025-26\nSCIENCE\n52\n52\n52\n52\n52\nThe movement of water across the plasma\nmembrane is also affected by the\namount of substance dissolved in water. Thus,\nosmosis is the net diffusion of water across a\nselectively permeable membrane toward a\nhigher solute concentration. What will happen if we put an animal cell\nor a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt\nin water? One of the following three things could\nhappen:\n1. If the medium surrounding the cell has\na higher water concentration than the\ncell, meaning that the outside solution\nis very dilute, the cell will gain water by\nosmosis. Such a solution is known as\na hypotonic solution. Water molecules are free to pass\nacross the cell membrane in both\ndirections, but more water will come\ninto the cell than will leave. The net\n(overall) result is that water enters the\ncell. The cell is likely to swell up. 2. If the medium has exactly the same\nwater concentration as the cell, there\nwill be no net movement of water across\nthe cell membrane. Such a solution is\nknown as an isotonic solution. Water crosses the cell membrane in\nboth directions, but the amount going\nin is the same as the amount going out,\nso there is no overall movement of\nwater. The cell will stay the same size. 3."}

Therefore the cell will shrink. Thus, osmosis is a special case of diffusion\nthrough a selectively permeable membrane. Now let us try out the following activity:\nActivity ______________ 5.3\n(a)\nRemove the shell of an egg by\ndissolving it in dilute hydrochloric\nacid. The shell is mostly calcium\ncarbonate.

(b)\nPlace a similar de-shelled egg in a\nconcentrated salt solution and observe\nfor 5 minutes. The egg shrinks. Why? Water passes out of the egg solution\ninto the salt solution because the salt\nsolution is more concentrated. We can also try a similar activity with dried\nraisins or apricots.

The nuclear\nmembrane has pores which allow the transfer\nof material from inside the nucleus to its\noutside, that is, to the cytoplasm (which we\nwill talk about in section 5.2.4). The nucleus contains chromosomes,\nwhich are visible as rod-shaped structures\nonly when the cell is about to divide. Chromosomes contain information for\ninheritance of characters from parents to next\ngeneration in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo\nNucleic Acid) molecules. Chromosomes are\ncomposed of DNA and protein. DNA molecules\ncontain the information necessary for\nconstructing and organising cells. Functional\nsegments of DNA are called genes. In a cell\nwhich is not dividing, this DNA is present as\npart of chromatin material. Chromatin\nmaterial is visible as entangled mass of thread\nlike structures. Whenever the cell is about to\ndivide, the chromatin material gets organised\ninto chromosomes. The nucleus plays a central role in cellular\nreproduction, the process by which a single\ncell divides and forms two new cells."}

Large and complex cells,\nincluding cells from multicellular organisms,\nneed a lot of chemical activities to support\ntheir complicated structure and function. To\nkeep these activities of different kinds\nseparate from each other, these cells use\nmembrane-bound little structures (or\n\u2018organelles\u2019) within themselves. This is one of\nthe features of the eukaryotic cells that\ndistinguish them from prokaryotic cells. Some\nof these organelles are visible only with an\nelectron microscope. We have talked about the nucleus in a\nprevious section. Some important examples\nof cell organelles which we will discuss now\nare: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus,\nlysosomes, mitochondria and plastids. They\nare important because they carry out some\nvery crucial functions in cells. 5.2.5 (i) ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER)\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a large\nnetwork of membrane-bound tubes and\nsheets. It looks like long tubules or round or\noblong bags (vesicles). The ER membrane is\nsimilar in structure to the plasma membrane. There are two types of ER\u2013 rough endoplasmic\nreticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic\nreticulum (SER)."}

For example, in Amoeba, a single\ncell carries out movement, intake of food,\ngaseous exchange and excretion. But in multi-\ncellular organisms there are millions of cells. Most of these cells are specialised to carry out\nspecific functions. Each specialised function\nis taken up by a different group of cells. Since\nthese cells carry out only a particular function,\nthey do it very efficiently. In human beings,\nmuscle cells contract and relax to cause\nmovement, nerve cells carry messages, blood\nflows to transport oxygen, food, hormones and\nwaste material and so on. In plants, vascular\ntissues conduct food and water from one part\nof the plant to other parts. So, multi-cellular\norganisms show division of labour. Cells\nspecialising in one function are often grouped\ntogether in the body. This means that a\nparticular function is carried out by a cluster\nof cells at a definite place in the body."}

Blood, phloem and\nmuscle are all examples of tissues. A group of cells that are similar in structure\nand/or work together to achieve a particular\nfunction forms a tissue. 6.1 Are Plants and Animals Made\nof Same Types of Tissues? Let us compare their structure and functions. Do plants and animals have the same\nstructure? Do they both perform similar\nfunctions? There are noticeable differences between\nthe two. Plants are stationary or fixed \u2013 they\ndon\u2019t move. Since they have to be upright, they\nhave a large quantity of supportive tissue. The\nsupportive tissue generally has dead cells. Animals on the other hand move around\nin search of food, mates and shelter. They\nconsume more energy as compared to plants. Most of the tissues they contain are living. Another difference between animals and\nplants is in the pattern of growth. The growth\nin plants is limited to certain regions, while this\nis not so in animals. There are some tissues in\nplants that divide throughout their life. These\ntissues are localised in certain regions. Based\non the dividing capacity of the tissues, various\nplant tissues can be classified as growing or\nmeristematic tissue and permanent tissue. Cell\ngrowth in animals is more uniform. So, there\nis no such demarcation of dividing and non-\ndividing regions in animals. The structural organisation of organs and\norgan systems is far more specialised and\nlocalised in complex animals than even in very\ncomplex plants.

Where\ndoes this oxygen go? It is absorbed in the lungs\nand then is transported to all the body cells\nthrough blood. Why would cells need oxygen? The functions of mitochondria we studied\nearlier provide a clue to this question. Blood\nflows and carries various substances from one\npart of the body to the other. For example, it\ncarries oxygen and food to all cells. It also\ncollects wastes from all parts of the body and\ncarries them to the liver and kidney for\ndisposal. Blood and muscles are both examples of\ntissues found in our body. On the basis of  the\nfunctions they perform we can think of different\ntypes of animal tissues, such as epithelial\ntissue, connective tissue, muscular tissue and\nnervous tissue. Blood is a type of connective\ntissue, and muscle forms muscular tissue. 6.3.1 EPITHELIAL TISSUE\nThe covering or protective tissues in the animal\nbody are epithelial tissues. Epithelium covers\nmost organs and cavities within the body. It\nalso forms a barrier to keep different body\nsystems separate. The skin, the lining of the\nmouth, the lining of blood vessels, lung alveoli\nand kidney tubules are all made of epithelial\ntissue. Epithelial tissue cells are tightly packed\nand form a continuous sheet. They have only\na small amount of cementing material between\nthem and almost no intercellular spaces. Obviously, anything entering or leaving the\nbody must cross at least one layer of\nepithelium. As a result, the permeability of the\ncells of various epithelia play an important role\nin regulating the exchange of materials\nbetween the body and the external\nenvironment and also between different parts\nof the body."}
{"source": "science_class_9.pdf", "chunk_id": 91, "content": "Regardless of the type, all\nepithelium is usually separated from the\nunderlying tissue by an extracellular fibrous\nbasement membrane. Different epithelia (Fig. 6.9) show differing\nstructures that correlate with their unique\nfunctions. For example, in cells lining blood\nvessels or lung alveoli, where transportation\nof substances occurs through a selectively\npermeable surface, there is a simple flat kind\nReprint 2025-26\nSCIENCE\n66\nFig. 6.9: Different types of epithelial tissues\nof skin). Simple squamous epithelial cells are\nextremely thin and flat and form a delicate\nlining. The oesophagus and the lining of the\nmouth are also covered with squamous\nepithelium. The skin, which protects the body,\nis also made of squamous epithelium. Skin\nepithelial cells are arranged in many layers to\nprevent wear and tear. Since they are arranged\nin a pattern of layers, the epithelium is called\nstratified squamous epithelium. Where absorption and secretion occur, as\nin the inner lining of the intestine, tall epithelial\ncells are present. This columnar (meaning\n\u2018pillar-like\u2019) epithelium facilitates movement\nacross the epithelial barrier. In the respiratory\ntract, the columnar epithelial tissue also has\ncilia, which are hair-like projections on the\nouter surfaces of epithelial cells. These cilia can\nmove, and their movement pushes the mucus\nforward to clear it. This type of epithelium is\nthus ciliated columnar epithelium. Cuboidal epithelium (with cube-shaped\ncells) forms the lining of kidney tubules and\nducts of salivary glands, where it provides\nmechanical support. Epithelial cells often\nacquire additional specialisation as gland cells,\nwhich can secrete substances at the epithelial\nsurface. Sometimes a portion of the epithelial\ntissue folds inward, and a multicellular gland\nis formed. This is glandular epithelium. 6.3.2 CONNECTIVE TISSUE\nBlood is a type of connective tissue.

For example, in the telecast of a\none-day cricket match, vertical bar graphs\nshow the run rate of a team in each over. As\nyou have studied in mathematics, a straight\nline graph helps in solving a linear equation\nhaving two variables. To describe the motion of an object, we\ncan use line graphs.

In this graph, time is taken along the x\u2013axis\nand distance is taken along the y-axis. Distance-time graphs can be employed under\nvarious conditions where objects move with\nuniform speed, non-uniform speed, remain\nat rest etc. Fig. 7.3:\nFig. 7.3:\nFig. 7.3:\nFig. 7.3:\nFig. 7.3: Distance-time graph of an object moving\nwith uniform speed\nWe know that when an object travels equal\ndistances in equal intervals of time, it moves\nwith uniform speed."}

Thus, for uniform\nspeed, a graph of distance travelled against\ntime is a straight line, as shown in Fig. 7.3. The portion OB of the graph shows that the\ndistance is increasing at a uniform rate. Note\nthat, you can also use the term uniform\nvelocity in place of uniform speed if you take\nthe magnitude of displacement equal to the\ndistance travelled by the object along the\ny-axis. We can use the distance-time graph to\ndetermine the speed of an object. To do so,\nconsider a small part AB of the distance-time\ngraph shown in Fig 7.3. Draw a line parallel\nto the x-axis from point A and another line\nparallel to the y-axis from point B. These two\nlines meet each other at point C to form a\ntriangle ABC. Now, on the graph, AC denotes\nthe time interval (t2 \u2013 t1) while BC corresponds\nto the distance (s2 \u2013 s1).

Such\nobservations suggest that rest is the \u201cnatural\nstate\u201d of an object.

In our everyday life we observe that some\neffort is required to put a stationary object\ninto motion or to stop a moving object. We\nordinarily experience this as a muscular effort\nand say that we must push or hit or pull on\nan object to change its state of motion. The\nconcept of force is based on this push, hit or\npull. Let us now ponder about a \u2018force\u2019. What\nis it? In fact, no one has seen, tasted or felt a\nforce. However, we always see or feel the effect\nof a force. It can only be explained by\ndescribing what happens when a force is\napplied to an object. Pushing, hitting and\npulling of objects are all ways of bringing\nobjects in motion (Fig. 8.1). They move because\nwe make a force act on them. From your studies in earlier classes, you\nare also familiar with the fact that a force can\nbe used to change the magnitude of velocity\nof an object (that is, to make the object move\nfaster or slower) or to change its direction of\nmotion.

This friction\nforce arises between two surfaces in contact;\nin this case, between the bottom of the box\nand floor\u2019s rough surface. It balances the\npushing force and therefore the box does not\nmove. In Fig. 8.4(b), the children push the box\nharder but the box still does not move. This is\nbecause the friction force still balances the\npushing force. If the children push the box\nharder still, the pushing force becomes bigger\nthan the friction force [Fig. 8.4(c)]. There is an unbalanced force. So the box\nstarts moving. What happens when we ride a bicycle? When we stop pedalling, the bicycle begins\nto slow down. This is again because of the\nfriction forces acting opposite to the direction\nof motion. In order to keep the bicycle moving,\nwe have to start pedalling again. It thus\nappears that an  object maintains its motion\nunder the continuous application of an\nunbalanced force. However, it is quite\nincorrect.

He observed that when a marble\nrolls down an inclined plane, its velocity\nincreases [Fig. 8.5(a)]. In the next chapter, you\nwill learn that the marble falls under the\nunbalanced force of gravity as it rolls down\nand attains a definite velocity by the time it\nreaches the bottom. Its velocity decreases\nwhen it climbs up as shown in Fig. 8.5(b). Fig. 8.5(c) shows a marble resting on an ideal\nfrictionless plane inclined on both sides. Galileo argued that when the marble is\nreleased from left, it would roll down the slope\nand go up on the opposite side to the same\nheight from which it was released. If the\ninclinations of the planes on both sides are\nequal then the marble will climb the same\ndistance that it covered while rolling down. If\nthe angle of inclination of the right-side plane\nwere gradually decreased, then the marble\nwould travel further distances till it reaches\nthe original height. If the right-side plane were\nultimately made horizontal (that is, the slope\nis reduced to zero), the marble would continue\nto travel forever trying to reach the same\nheight that it was released from. The\nunbalanced forces on the marble in this case\nare zero. It thus suggests that an unbalanced\n(external) force is required to change the\nmotion of the marble but no net force is\nneeded to sustain the uniform motion of the\nmarble. In practical situations it is difficult\nto achieve a zero unbalanced force. This is\nbecause of the presence of the frictional force\nacting opposite to the direction of motion."}

The effect of the\nfrictional force may be minimised by using a\nsmooth marble and a smooth plane and\nproviding a lubricant on top of the planes. Fig. 8.5: (a) the downward motion; (b) the upward\nmotion of a marble on an inclined plane;\nand (c) on a double inclined plane. Newton further studied Galileo\u2019s ideas on\nforce and motion and presented three\nfundamental laws that govern the motion of\nobjects. These three laws are known as\nNewton\u2019s laws of motion. The first law of\nmotion is stated as:\nAn object remains in a state of rest or of\nuniform motion in a straight line unless\ncompelled to change that state by an\napplied force. In other words, all objects resist a change\nin their state of motion. In a qualitative way,\nthe tendency of undisturbed objects to stay\nat rest or to keep moving with the same\nvelocity is called inertia. This is why, the first\nlaw of motion is also known as the law\nof inertia. Certain experiences that we come across\nwhile travelling in a motorcar can be\nexplained on the basis of the law of inertia. We tend to remain at rest with respect to the\nseat until the driver applies a braking force\nto stop the motorcar. With the application of\nbrakes, the car slows down but our body\ntends to continue in the same state of motion\nbecause of its inertia. A sudden application of\nbrakes may thus cause injury to us by impact\nReprint 2025-26\nSCIENCE\n90\nor collision with the panels in front. Safety belts\nare worn to prevent such accidents.

Now\nwe tend to fall backwards. This is because the\nsudden start of the bus brings motion to the\nbus as well as to our feet in contact with the\nfloor of the bus. But the rest of our body\nopposes this motion because of its inertia. When a motorcar makes a sharp turn at a\nhigh speed, we tend to get thrown to one side. This can again be explained on the basis of\nthe law of inertia. We tend to continue in our\nstraight-line motion. When an unbalanced\nforce is applied by the engine to change the\ndirection of motion of the motorcar, we slip to\none side of the seat due to the inertia of\nour body.

In other words, there appears to exist\nsome quantity of importance that combines\nthe object\u2019s mass and its velocity. One such\nproperty called momentum was introduced by\nNewton.

All living beings need food. Living beings\nhave to perform several basic activities to\nsurvive. We call such activities \u2018life processes\u2019. The energy for these processes comes from\nfood. We need energy for other activities like\nplaying, singing, reading, writing, thinking,\njumping, cycling and running. Activities that\nare strenuous require more energy. Animals too get engaged in activities. For\nexample, they may jump and run. They have\nto fight, move away from enemies, find food\nor find a safe place to live. Also, we engage\nsome animals to lift weights, carry loads, pull\ncarts or plough fields. All such activities\nrequire energy. Think of machines. List the machines that\nyou have come across.

There is a difference in the\nway we use the term \u2018work\u2019 in day-to-day life\nand the way we use it in science.

This is because work is\ndone on it against gravity while it is being\nraised. The energy present in such an object\nis the gravitational potential energy. The gravitational potential energy of an\nobject at a point above the ground is defined\nas the work done in raising it from the ground\nto that point against gravity. It is easy to arrive at an expression for\nthe gravitational potential energy of an object\nat a height. Fig. 10.7\nConsider an object of mass, m. Let it be\nraised through a height, h from the ground. A force is required to do this. The minimum\nforce required to raise the object is equal to\nthe weight of the object, mg. The object gains\nenergy equal to the work done on it. Let the\nwork done on the object against gravity be\nW. That is,\nwork done, W = force \u00d7 displacement\n= mg \u00d7 h\n= mgh\nSince work done on the object is equal to\nmgh, an energy equal to mgh units is gained\nby the object. This is the potential energy (EP)\nof the object. Ep = mgh\n(10.6)\nMore to know\nThe potential energy of an object at\na height depends on the ground level\nor the zero level you choose. An\nobject in a given position can have a\ncertain potential energy with respect\nto one level and a different value of\npotential energy with respect to\nanother level."}

What happens to the total\nenergy of a system during or after the process? Whenever energy gets transformed, the total\nenergy remains unchanged. This is the law of\nconservation of energy. According to this law,\nenergy can only be converted from one form\nto another; it can neither be created or\ndestroyed. The total energy before and after\nthe transformation remains the same. The law\nof conservation of energy is valid                  in\nall situations and for all kinds of\ntransformations. Consider a simple example. Let an object\nof mass, m be made to fall freely from a     height,\nh. At the start, the potential energy is mgh and\nkinetic energy is zero. Why is the kinetic\nenergy zero? It is zero because its velocity is\nzero. The total energy of the object is thus mgh. As it falls, its potential energy will change into\nkinetic energy."}
{"source": "science_class_9.pdf", "chunk_id": 182, "content": "If v is the velocity of the object\nat a given instant, the kinetic energy would be\n\u00bdmv2. As the fall of the object continues, the\npotential energy would decrease while the\nkinetic energy would increase. When the object\nis about to reach the ground, h = 0 and v will\nbe the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy\nwould be the largest and potential energy the\nleast. However, the sum of the potential energy\nand kinetic energy of the object would be the\nsame at all points. That is,\npotential energy + kinetic energy = constant\n   or\n1\nconstant. 2\n2\nmgh +\nmv =\n(10.7)\nThe sum of kinetic energy and potential energy\nof an object is its total mechanical energy. We find that during the free fall of the object,\nthe decrease in potential energy, at any point\nin its path, appears as an equal amount of\nincrease in kinetic energy. (Here the effect of\nair resistance on the motion of the object has\nbeen ignored.) There is thus a continual\ntransformation of gravitational potential\nenergy into kinetic energy.

We talk of the power\nof machines like motorbikes and motorcars. The speed with which these vehicles change\nenergy or do work is a basis for their\nclassification. Power measures the speed of\nwork done, that is, how fast or slow work is\ndone. Power is defined as the rate of doing\nwork or the rate of transfer of energy."}

We can also say that power is 1 W when the\nrate of consumption of energy is    1 J s\u20131. 1 watt = 1 joule/second or 1 W = 1 J s\u20131.

A particle of\nthe medium in contact with the vibrating\nobject is first displaced from its equilibrium\nposition. It then exerts a force on the adjacent\nparticle. As a result of which the adjacent\nparticle gets displaced from its position of\nrest. After displacing the adjacent particle the\nfirst particle comes back to its original\nposition. This process continues in the\nmedium till the sound reaches your ear. The\ndisturbance created by a source of  sound in\nthe medium travels through the medium and\nnot the particles of the medium. A wave is a disturbance that moves\nthrough a medium when the particles of the\nmedium set neighbouring particles into\nmotion. They in turn produce similar motion\nin others. The particles of the medium do not\nmove forward themselves, but the\ndisturbance is carried forward. This is what\nhappens during propagation of sound in a\nmedium, hence sound can be visualised as a\nwave. Sound waves are characterised by the\nmotion of particles in the medium and are\ncalled mechanical waves. Air is the most common medium through\nwhich sound travels.

These waves are called longitudinal\nwaves. In these waves the individual particles\nof the medium move in a direction parallel to\nthe direction of propagation of the disturbance. The particles do not move from one place to\nanother but they simply oscillate back and\nforth about their position of rest. This is\nexactly how a sound wave propagates, hence\nsound waves are longitudinal waves. There is also another type of wave, called\na transverse wave. In a transverse wave\nparticles do not oscillate along the direction\nof wave propagation but oscillate up and down\nabout their mean position as the wave travels. Thus, a transverse wave is the one in which\nthe individual particles of the medium move\nabout their mean positions in a direction\nperpendicular to the direction of wave\npropagation. When we drop a pebble in a\npond, the waves you see on the water surface\nis an example of transverse wave.

The\nspeed of sound depends on the properties of\nthe medium through which it travels. You will\nlearn about this dependence in higher classes. The speed of sound in a medium depends on\ntemperature of the medium. The speed of\nsound decreases when we go from solid to\ngaseous state.

This sound which we\nhear is called an echo. The sensation of\nsound persists in our brain for about 0.1\ns. To hear a distinct echo the time interval\nbetween the original sound and the\nreflected one must be  at least 0.1s. If we\ntake the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a\ngiven temperature, say at 22 \u00baC in air, the\nsound must go to the obstacle and reach\nback the ear of the listener on reflection after\n0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by\nthe sound from the point of generation to\nthe reflecting surface and back should be\nat least (344 m/s) \u00d7 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus,\nfor hearing distinct echoes, the minimum\ndistance of the obstacle from the source of\nsound must be half of this distance, that\nis, 17.2 m. This distance will change with\nthe temperature of air. Echoes may be heard\nmore than once due to successive or\nmultiple reflections.

We obtain most of this food\nfrom agriculture and animal husbandry. We read in newspapers that efforts are\nalways being made to improve production\nfrom agriculture and animal husbandry. Why\nis this necessary? Why we cannot make do\nwith the current levels of production? India is a very populous country. Our\npopulation is more than one billion people,\nand it is still growing. As food for this growing\npopulation, we will soon need more than a\nquarter of a billion tonnes of grain every year. This can be done by farming on more land. But India is already intensively cultivated. As\na result, we do not have any major scope for\nincreasing the area of land under cultivation. Therefore, it is necessary to increase our\nproduction efficiency for both crops and\nlivestock. Efforts to meet the food demand by\nincreasing food production have led to some\nsuccesses so far. We have had the green\nrevolution, which contributed to increased\nfood-grain production. We have also had the\nwhite revolution, which has led to better and\nmore efficient use as well as availability of milk. However, these revolutions mean that our\nnatural resources are getting used more\nintensively."}

How has this increase\nin production been achieved? If we think of\nthe practices involved in farming, we can see\nthat we can divide it into three stages. The\nfirst is the choice of seeds for planting. The\nsecond is the nurturing of the crop plants. The third is the protection of the growing and\nharvested crops from loss. Thus, the major\ngroups of activities for improving crop yields\ncan be classified as:\n\u2022\nCrop variety improvement\n\u2022\nCrop production improvement\n\u2022\nCrop protection management. 12.1.1 CROP VARIETY IMPROVEMENT\nThis approach depends on finding a crop\nvariety that can give a good yield. Varieties or\nstrains of crops can be selected by breeding\nfor various useful characteristics such as\ndisease resistance, response to fertilisers,\nproduct quality and high yields. One way of\nincorporating desirable characters into crop\nvarieties is by hybridisation. Hybridisation\nrefers to crossing between genetically\ndissimilar plants.

Fish production includes the finned\ntrue fish as well as shellfish such as prawns\nand molluscs. There are two ways of obtaining\nfish. One is from natural resources, which is\ncalled capture fishing. The other way is by\nfish farming, which is called culture fishery. The water source of the fish can be either\nseawater or fresh water, such as in rivers and\nponds. Fishing can thus be done both by\ncapture and culture of fish in marine and\nfreshwater ecosystems. 12.2.3 (i) MARINE FISHERIES\nIndia\u2019s marine fishery resources include\n7500 km of coastline and the deep seas\nFig."}

While\ncapture fishing is also done in such inland\nwater bodies, the yield is not high. Most fish\nproduction from these resources is through\naquaculture. Fish culture is sometimes done in\ncombination with a rice crop, so that fish are\ngrown in the water in the paddy field. More\nintensive fish farming can be done in\ncomposite fish culture systems. Both local\nand imported fish species are used in such\nsystems. In such a system, a combination of five or\nsix fish species is used in a single fishpond. These species are selected so that they do\nnot compete for food among them having\ndifferent types of food habits. As a result, the\nfood available in all the parts of the pond is\nused. As Catlas are surface feeders, Rohus\nfeed in the middle-zone of the pond, Mrigals\nand Common Carps are bottom feeders, and\nGrass Carps feed on the weeds, together these\nspecies (Fig. 12.6) can use all the food in the\npond without competing with each other.

To overcome this problem, ways\nhave now been worked out to breed these fish\nin ponds using hormonal stimulation."}

Since bee-keeping\nneeds low investments, farmers use it as an\nadditional income generating activity. In\naddition to honey, the beehives are a source\nof wax which is used in various medicinal\npreparations. The local varieties of bees used for\ncommercial honey production are Apis cerana\nindica, commonly known as the Indian bee,\nA. dorsata, the rock bee and A. florae, the little\nbee. An Italian bee variety, A. mellifera, has\nalso been brought in to increase yield of honey. This is the variety commonly used for\ncommercial honey production. The Italian bees have high honey collection\ncapacity. They sting somewhat less. They stay\nin a given beehive for long periods, and breed\nvery well. For commercial honey production,\nbee farms or apiaries are established. The value or quality of honey depends\nupon the pasturage, or the flowers available\nto the bees for nectar and pollen collection. In addition to adequate quantity of pasturage,\nthe kind of flowers available will determine\nthe taste of the honey. uestions\n1.
