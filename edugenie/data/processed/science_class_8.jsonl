Later, they\ncould cultivate land and produce rice,\nwheat and other food crops. Thus,\nwas born \u2018Agriculture\u2019. When plants of the same kind are\ncultivated at one place on a large scale,\nit is called a crop. For example, crop of\nwheat means that all the plants grown\nin a field are that of wheat. You already know that crops are of\ndifferent types like cereals, vegetables\nand fruits. These can be classified on the\nbasis of the season in which they grow. India is a vast country. The climatic\nconditions like temperature, humidity\nand rainfall vary from one region to\nanother. Accordingly, there is a rich\nYou have learnt that all living\norganisms require food.

But, first of all why do we have to eat\nfood? You already know that energy from\nthe food is utilised by organisms for\ncarrying out their various body\nfunctions, such as digestion, respiration\nand excretion. We get our food from\nplants, or animals, or both."}

The rainy season in India\nis generally from June to September. Paddy, maize, soyabean, groundnut and\ncotton are kharif crops. (ii) Rabi Crops : The crops grown in the\nwinter season (October to March) are\ncalled rabi crops. Examples of rabi\ncrops are wheat, gram, pea, mustard\nand linseed.

One of the most\nimportant tasks in agriculture is to turn\nthe soil and loosen it. This allows the\nroots to penetrate deep into the soil. The\nloose soil allows the roots to breathe\neasily even when they go deep into the\nsoil. Why does the loosening of soil allow\nthe roots to breathe easily? The loosened soil helps in the growth\nof earthworms and microbes present in\nthe soil. These organisms are friends of\nthe farmer since they further turn and\nloosen the soil and add humus to it.

Soil supplies mineral nutrients to the\ncrop plants. These nutrients are\nessential for the growth of plants. In\ncertain areas, farmers grow crop after\ncrop in the same field. The field is never\nleft uncultivated or fallow. Imagine what\nhappens to the nutrients? Continuous cultivation of crops\nmakes the soil poor in nutrients. Therefore, farmers have to add manure\nto the fields to replenish the soil with\nnutrients. This process is called\nmanuring. Improper or insufficient\nmanuring results in weak plants. Manure is an organic substance\nobtained from the decomposition of\nplant or animal wastes. Farmers dump\nplant and animal waste in pits at open\nplaces and allow it to decompose. The\ndecomposition is caused by some\nmicroorganisms. The decomposed\nmatter is used as organic manure.

How are\nthey different from manure? Fertilisers\nare produced in factories. Some\nexamples of fertilisers are\u2014 urea,\nammonium \nsulphate, \nsuper\nphosphate, potash, NPK (Nitrogen,\nPhosphorus, Potassium). The use of fertilisers has helped\nfarmers to get better yield of crops\nsuch as wheat, paddy and maize. But\nexcessive use of fertilisers has made\nthe soil less fertile. Fertilisers have  also\nbecome a source of water pollution. Therefore, in order to maintain the\nfertility of the soil, we have to\nsubstitute fertilisers with organic\nmanure or leave the field uncultivated\n(fallow) in between two crops. The use of manure improves soil\ntexture as well as its water retaining\ncapacity. It replenishes the soil with\nnutrients. Another method of replenishing\nthe soil with nutrients is through crop\nrotation. This can be done by growing\ndifferent crops alternately. Earlier,\nfarmers in northern India used to\ngrow legumes as fodder in one season\nand wheat in the next season. This\nhelped in the replenishment of the soil\nwith nitrogen. Farmers are being\nencouraged to adopt this practice. In the previous classes, you have\nlearnt about Rhizobium  bacteria. These are present in the nodules of\nroots of leguminous plants.

Water is important for proper growth\nand development. Water is absorbed by\nthe plant roots. Along with water,\nminerals and fertilisers are also\nabsorbed. Plants contain nearly 90%\nwater. Water is essential because\ngermination of seeds does not take place\nunder dry conditions. Nutrients\ndissolved in water are transported to\neach part of the plant. Water also\nprotects the crop from both frost and\nhot air currents. To maintain the\nmoisture of the soil for healthy crop\ngrowth, fields have to be watered\nregularly. The supply of water to crops at\nregular intervals is called irrigation. The\ntime and frequency of irrigation varies\nfrom crop to crop, soil to soil and season\nto season. In summer, the frequency of\nwatering is higher. Why is it so? Could\nit be due to the increased rate of\nevaporation of water from the soil and\nthe leaves?

Have these other\nplants been planted\npurposely? In a field many other undesirable\nplants may grow naturally along with\nthe crop. These undesirable plants are\ncalled weeds. The removal of weeds is called\nweeding. Weeding is necessary since\nweeds compete with the crop plants for\nwater, nutrients, space and light. Thus,\nthey affect the growth of the crop. Some\nweeds interfere even in harvesting and\nmay be poisonous for animals and\nhuman beings. Farmers adopt many ways to remove\nweeds and control their growth. Tilling\nbefore sowing of crops helps in\nuprooting and killing of weeds, which\nmay then dry up and get mixed with\nthe soil. The best time for the removal\nof weeds is before they produce flowers\nand seeds. The manual removal includes\nphysical removal of weeds by uprooting\nor cutting them close to the ground,\nfrom time to time. This is done with the\nhelp of a khurpi. A seed drill [Fig. 1.2(b)]\nis also used to uproot weeds. Weeds are also controlled by using\ncertain chemicals, called weedicides,\nlike 2,4-D. These are sprayed in the\nfields to kill the weeds. They do not\ndamage the crops."}

New\ninformation about agriculture is obtained through radio, T.V. and\nother sources. As a result we are able to get good crops on a large\nscale. This year we got 9 to 11 quintals of gram crop/acre and 20\nto 25 quintals of wheat/acre. In my opinion awareness of new\ntechnology is important for better crop yield.

If a fire\nbreaks out in your house or in your\nneighbourhood, the first thing to do\nis to call the fire service. Does your city/town have a fire\nbrigade station? When a fire brigade arrives, what\ndoes it do? It pours water on the fire\n(Fig. 4.6). Water cools the combustible\nmaterial so that its temperature is\nbrought \nbelow \nits \nignition\ntemperature.

These are: fuel, air (to supply\noxygen) and heat (to raise the\ntemperature of the fuel beyond the\nignition temperature). Fire can be\ncontrolled by removing one or more of\nthese requirements. The job of a fire\nextinguisher is to cut off the supply of\nair, or to bring down the temperature\nof the fuel, or both.

If electrical\nequipment is on fire, water\nmay conduct electricity\nand harm those trying to\ndouse the fire. Water is\nalso not suitable for fires\ninvolving oil and petrol. Do\nyou recall that water is\nheavier than oil? So, it\nsinks below the oil, and oil\nkeeps burning on the top. For fires involving electrical equipment and inflammable materials like\npetrol, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best extinguisher. CO2, being heavier than\noxygen, covers the fire like a blanket. Since the contact between the fuel and\noxygen is cut off, the fire is controlled. The added advantage of CO2 is that in\nmost cases it does not harm the electrical equipment. How do we get the supply of carbon dioxide? It can be stored at high pressure\nas a liquid in cylinders. In what form is the LPG stored in cylinders? When\nreleased from the cylinder, CO2 expands enormously in volume and cools down. So, it not only forms a blanket around the fire, it also brings down the\ntemperature of the fuel. That is why it is an excellent fire extinguisher. Another\nway to get CO2 is to release a lot of dry powder of chemicals like sodium\nbicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate. Near the fire, these\nchemicals give off CO2. CAUTION : Do not handle the gas\nstove yourself. Ask your parents\nto help. Fig. 4.7 : Fire extinguisher\nin most cases cannot be eliminated.

You will\nremember that plants that reproduce\nsexually have male and female\nreproductive parts. Can you name these\nparts?

When sperms come in\ncontact with an egg, one of the sperms\nmay fuse with the egg. Such fusion of\nthe egg and the sperm is called\nfertilisation (Fig. 6.5). During\nfertilisation, the nuclei of the sperm and\nthe egg fuse to form a single nucleus. This results in the formation of a\nfertilised egg or zygote (Fig. 6.6).

In such cases, doctors\ncollect freshly released egg and\nsperms and keep them together for a\nfew hours for IVF or in vitro\nfertilisation (fertilisation outside the\nbody). In case fertilisation occurs,\nthe zygote is allowed to develop for\nabout a week and then it is placed in\nthe mother\u2019s uterus.

This causes\nchanges in boys about which you have\njust learnt, for example, the growth of\nfacial hair. Once puberty is reached in\ngirls, ovaries begin to produce the female\nhormone or estrogen which makes the\nbreasts develop. Milk secreting glands\nor mammary glands develop inside the\nbreasts.

During this\nperiod, the wall of the uterus becomes\nthick so as to receive the egg, in case\nit is fertilised and begins to develop. This results in pregnancy. If\nfertilisation does not occur, the\nreleased egg, and the thickened lining\nof the uterus along with its blood\nvessels are shed off. This causes\nbleeding in women which is called\nmenstruation. Menstruation occurs\nonce in about 28 to 30 days. The first\nmenstrual flow begins at puberty  and\nis termed menarche. At 45 to 50 years\nof age, the menstrual cycle stops. Stoppage of menstruation is termed\nmenopause. Initially, menstrual cycle\nmay be irregular. It take some time to\nbecome regular. Menstrual cycle is controlled by\nhormones.

In\nperforming these tasks they use\nmuscular force (Fig. 8.9). 2024-25\nFORCE AND PRESSURE\n101\nSince muscular force can be applied\nonly when it is in contact with an object,\nit is also called a contact force. Are there\nother types of contact forces? Let us find\nout. Friction\nRecall some of your experiences. A ball\nrolling along the ground gradually slows\ndown and finally comes to rest. When\nwe stop pedalling a bicycle, it gradually\nslows down and finally comes to a stop. A car or a scooter also comes to rest\nonce its engine is switched off. Similarly,\na boat comes to rest if we stop rowing\nit. Can you add some more such\nexperiences? In all these situations no force\nappears to be acting on the objects, yet\ntheir speed gradually decreases and\nthey come to rest after some time. What\ncauses a change in their state of motion? Could some force be acting on them! Can you guess the direction in which\nthe force must be acting in each case? The force responsible for changing the\nstate of motion of objects in all these\nexamples is the force of friction. It is the\nforce of friction between the surface of\nthe ball and the ground that brings the\nmoving ball to rest."}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 102, "content": "Similarly, friction\nbetween water and the boat brings it to\na stop once you stop rowing. The force of friction always acts on\nall the moving objects and its direction\nis always opposite to the direction of\nmotion.

You may be wondering whether it is\nessential for the agent applying a force\non an object to be always in contact with\nit.

Leaves and fruits also fall to the ground\nwhen they get detached from the plant. Have you ever wondered why it is so? When the coin is held in your hand it\nis at rest. As soon as it is released, it\nbegins to move downwards. It is clear that\nthe state of motion of the coin undergoes\na change. Can this happen without a\nforce acting on it? Which is this force? Does the magnet on the rollers begin\nto move when the other magnet is brought\nnear it? Does it always move in the\ndirection of the approaching magnet? What do these observations suggest? Does\nit mean that some force must be acting\nbetween the two magnets? You have learnt in Class VI that like\npoles of two magnets repel each other and\nunlike poles attract each other. Attraction\nor repulsion between objects can also be\nseen as another form of pull or push. Do\nyou have to bring the magnets in contact\nfor observing the force between them?

Try cutting vegetables with a blunt\nknife  and then with a sharp knife. Which\nis easier? Do you get the feeling that the area\nover which the force is applied (for\nexample, the pointed end of the nail)\nplays a role in making these tasks easier? The force acting on a unit area of a\nsurface is called pressure. pressure = force / area on which it acts\nAt this stage we consider only those\nforces which act perpendicular to the\nsurface on which the pressure is to\nbe computed.

In this game a person is\nblind-folded and has to catch the\nremaining players. How is the blind-\nfolded person able to guess which player\nis closest to her? Sound plays an important role in our\nlives. It helps us to communicate with\none another. We hear a variety of sounds\nin our surroundings. Make a list of sounds you hear in\nyour surroundings. In the music room of your school you\nhear the sounds produced by musical\ninstruments \nlike \nflute, \ntabla,\nharmonium, etc. (Fig. 10.1). How is sound produced? How does it\ntravel from one place to another? How\ndo we hear sound? Why are some sounds\nlouder than others?"}

Fig. 10.15 : Understanding action of an eardrum\n10.4 We Hear Sound through\nOur Ears\nThe shape of the outer part of the ear is\nlike a funnel. When sound enters it, it\ntravels down a canal at the end of which\nthere is a thin stretched membrane. It\nis called the eardrum. It performs an\nimportant function. To understand what\nthe eardrum does, let us build a tin-can\nmodel of the eardrum. Activity 10.10\nTake a plastic or tin-can. Cut its\nends.

{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 132, "content": "In which\ncase is the amplitude larger? Loudness of sound is proportional to\nthe square of the amplitude of the\nvibration producing the sound. For\nexample, if the amplitude becomes\ntwice, the loudness increases by a\nfactor of 4. The loudness is expressed\nin a unit called decibel (dB). The\nfollowing table gives some idea of the\nloudness of sound coming from\nvarious sources. Normal breathing\n10 dB\nSoft whisper (at 5m)\n30 dB\nNormal conversation\n60 dB\nBusy traffic\n70 dB\nAverage factory\n80 dB\nAbove 80 dB the noise becomes\nphysically painful. I wonder why my voice\nis different from that of\nmy teacher. Compare the sound of a baby with\nthat of an adult. Is there any difference? Even if two sounds are equally loud,\nthey differ in some way. Let us see how. Fig. 10.18 : Frequency \ndetermines \nthe\npitch of a sound\nThe loudness of sound depends on\nits amplitude. When the amplitude of\nvibration is large, the sound produced\nis loud. When the amplitude is small,\nthe sound produced is feeble. The frequency determines the\nshrillness or pitch of a sound. If the\nfrequency of vibration is higher we say\nthat the sound is shrill and has a higher\npitch. If the frequency of vibration is\nlower, we say that the sound has a lower\npitch. For example, a drum vibrates with\na low frequency. Therefore, it produces\n2024-25\nSCIENCE\n132\na low-pitched sound. On the other\nhand, a whistle has a high frequency\nand therefore, produces a sound of\nhigher pitch (Fig. 10.18). A bird makes\na high-pitched sound whereas a lion\nmakes a low-pitched roar. However, the\nroar of a lion is very loud while the\nsound of the bird is quite feeble."}

Can you say\nthat the frequency of the voice of a child\nis higher than that of an adult? Usually the voice of a woman has\na higher  frequency than that of a\nman. 10.6 Audible and Inaudible\nSounds\nWe know that we need a vibrating body\nfor the production of sound. Can we\nhear the sound of all vibrating bodies? The fact is that sounds of frequencies\nless than about 20 vibrations per second\n(20 Hz) cannot be detected by the  human\near. Such sounds are called inaudible. On the higher side, sounds of  frequencies\nhigher than about 20,000 vibrations per\nsecond (20 kHz) are also not audible to\nthe  human ear. Thus, for human ear,\nthe range of audible frequencies is\nroughly from 20 to 20,000 Hz. Some animals can hear sounds of\nfrequencies higher than 20,000 Hz. Dogs have this ability. The police use\nhigh frequency whistles which dogs can\nhear but humans cannot. The ultrasound equipment, familiar\nto us for investigating and tracking\nmany medical problems, works at\nfrequencies higher than 20,000 Hz. 10.7 Noise and Music\nWe hear different types of sounds\naround us. Is the sound always\npleasing? Does a sound sometimes\ncause discomfort to you? Some sounds\nare pleasant to the ear, whereas some\nare not. Suppose construction work is going\non in your neighbourhood. Are the\nsounds coming from the construction\nsite pleasing? Do you enjoy the sounds\nproduced by horns of buses and trucks? Such unpleasant sounds are called\nnoise. In a classroom, if all the students\nspeak together, what would the sound\nproduced be called? On the other hand you enjoy sounds\nfrom musical instruments."}

Presence of unwanted gases and\nparticles in air is called air pollution. Similarly, presence of excessive or\nunwanted sounds in the environment\nis called noise pollution. Can you list\nsome sources of noise pollution? Major\ncauses of noise pollution are sounds of\nvehicles, explosions including bursting\nof crackers, machines, loudspeakers etc. What sources in the home may lead to\nnoise? Television and transistor radio\nat high volumes, some kitchen\nappliances, desert coolers, air\nconditioners, all contribute to noise\npollution. 2024-25\nSOUND\n133\nHearing Impairment\nTotal hearing impairment, which is rare, is usually from birth itself. Partial\ndisability is generally the result of a disease, injury or age. Children with\nimpaired hearing need special care. By learning sign language, such children\ncan communicate effectively. Because speech develops as the direct result of\nhearing, a child with a hearing loss may have defective speech also. Technological devices for the hearing-impaired have made it possible for such\npersons to improve their quality of life. Society can do much to  improve the\nliving environment for the hearing-impaired and help them live normal lives. What are the Harms of Noise\nPollution? Do you know that presence of excessive\nnoise in the surroundings may cause\nmany health related problems. Lack of\nsleep, hypertension (high blood-\npressure), anxiety and many more health\ndisorders may be caused by noise\npollution. A person who is exposed to a\nloud sound continuously may get\ntemporary \nor \neven \npermanent\nimpairment of hearing."}

For this, silencing devices\nmust be installed in air craft engines,\ntransport vehicles, industrial\nmachines and home appliances. How can the noise pollution be\ncontrolled in a residential area? All noisy operations must be\nconducted away from any residential\narea. Noise producing industries\nshould be set up away from such\nareas. Use of automobile horns\nshould be minimised.

Can this apparatus\nbe used to detect whether a body is\ncharged or not? Can you explain\nwhy the foil strips repel each other? The aluminium foil strips receive the\nsame charge from the charged refill\nthrough the paper clip (remember that\nmetals are good conductors of\nelectricity). The strips carrying similar\ncharges repel each other and they\nbecome wide open. Such a device can\nbe used to test whether an object is\ncarrying charge or not. This device is\nknown as electroscope. Thus, we find that electrical charge\ncan be transferred from a charged object\nto another through a metal conductor.

Earthing is provided in buildings to\nprotect us from electrical shocks due\nto any leakage of electrical current. 12.5 The Story of Lightning\nIt is now possible to explain lightning\nin terms of the charges produced by\nrubbing. During the development of a\nthunderstorm, the air currents move\nupward while the water droplets move\ndownward. These vigorous movements\ncause separation of charges. By a\nprocess, not yet completely understood,\nthe positive charges collect near the\nupper edges of the clouds and the\nnegative charges accumulate near the\nlower edges. There is accumulation of\npositive charges near the ground also. When \nthe \nmagnitude \nof \nthe\naccumulated charges becomes very\nlarge, the air which is normally a poor\nconductor of electricity, is no longer able\nto resist their flow. Negative and positive\ncharges meet, producing streaks of\nbright light and sound. We see streaks\nas lightning (Fig. 12.5). The process is\ncalled an electric discharge. Fig. 12.5 : Accumulation of charges leading to lightning. 2024-25\nSOME NATURAL PHENOMENA\n155\nThe process of electric discharge can\noccur between two or more clouds, or\nbetween clouds and the earth. Today we\nneed not get frightened by lightning like\nour ancestors did. Now we understand\nthe basic phenomenon. Scientists are\ntrying \nhard \nto \nimprove \nthis\nunderstanding. However, lightning\nstrike could destroy life and property. It\nis, therefore, necessary to take measures\nto protect ourselves. 12.6 Lightning Safety\nDuring lightning and thunderstorm no\nopen place is safe. l\nHearing thunder is an alert to rush\nto a safer place."}

What\nhappens if two plane mirrors are used\nin combination? Let us see. Do We See all Objects due to Reflected Light? Nearly everything you see around is seen due to reflected light. Moon, for example,\nreceives light from the Sun and reflects it. That\u2019s how we see the moon. The objects\nwhich shine in the light of other objects are called illuminated objects. Can you\nname some other such objects? There are other objects, which give their own light, such as the Sun, fire, flame\nof a candle and an electric lamp. Their light falls on our eyes. That is how we see\nthem. The objects which emit their own light are known as luminous objects. Fig. 13.9 : Mirror at the hair dresser shop\nI have a question.

In the iris, there is a small\nopening called the pupil. The size of\nthe pupil is controlled by the iris. The\niris is that part of eye which gives it its\ndistinctive colour.

There are two\nkinds of cells\u2013\n(i) cones, which are sensitive to bright\nlight and\n(ii) rods, which are sensitive to dim light. Cones sense colour.
