Their uncle is a farmer. One day they saw some tools like khurpi, sickle, shovel, plough, etc., in the field. In order to provide food for a large population\u2014 regular production, proper management and distribution is necessary. 1.1 Agricultural Practices Till 10,000 B.C.E. people were nomadic. They were wandering in groups from place to place in search of food and shelter. They ate raw fruits and vegetables and started hunting animals for food. Later, they could cultivate land and produce rice, wheat and other food crops. Thus, was born \u2018Agriculture\u2019. When plants of the same kind are cultivated at one place on a large scale, it is called a crop. For example, crop of wheat means that all the plants grown in a field are that of wheat. You already know that crops are of different types like cereals, vegetables and fruits. These can be classified on the basis of the season in which they grow. India is a vast country. The climatic conditions like temperature, humidity and rainfall vary from one region to another. Accordingly, there is a rich You have learnt that all living organisms require food. Plants can make their food themselves. Can you recall how green plants synthesise their own food? Animals including humans can not make their own food. So, where do animals get their food from? But, first of all why do we have to eat food? You already know that energy from the food is utilised by organisms for carrying out their various body functions, such as digestion, respiration and excretion. We get our food from plants, or animals, or both."}

These are: (i) Kharif Crops : The crops which are sown in the rainy season are called kharif crops. The rainy season in India is generally from June to September. Paddy, maize, soyabean, groundnut and cotton are kharif crops. (ii) Rabi Crops : The crops grown in the winter season (October to March) are called rabi crops. Examples of rabi crops are wheat, gram, pea, mustard and linseed. Besides these, pulses and vegetables are grown during summer at many places. 1.2 Basic Practices of Crop Production to as agricultural practices which are listed below: (i) Preparation of soil (ii) Sowing (iii) Adding manure and fertilisers (iv) Irrigation (v) Protecting from weeds (vi) Harvesting (vii) Storage 1.3 Preparation of Soil The preparation of soil is the first step before growing a crop. One of the most important tasks in agriculture is to turn the soil and loosen it. This allows the roots to penetrate deep into the soil. The loose soil allows the roots to breathe easily even when they go deep into the soil. Why does the loosening of soil allow the roots to breathe easily? The loosened soil helps in the growth of earthworms and microbes present in the soil. These organisms are friends of the farmer since they further turn and loosen the soil and add humus to it. But why the soil needs to be turned and loosened?"}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 2, "content": "You have learnt in the previous classes that soil contains minerals, water, air and some living organisms. In addition, dead plants and animals get decomposed by soil organisms. In this way, various nutrients in the dead organisms are released back into the soil. These nutrients are again absorbed by plants. Since only a few centimetres of the top layer of soil supports plant growth, turning and loosening of soil brings the nutrient-rich soil to the top so that plants can use these nutrients. Thus, Why paddy can not be grown in the winter season? Paddy requires a lot of water. Therefore, it is grown only in the rainy season. Cultivation of crops involves several activities undertaken by farmers over a period of time. You may find that these activities are similar to those carried out by a gardener or even by you when you grow ornamental plants in your house. These activities or tasks are referred 2024-25 CROP PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT 3 turning and loosening of soil is very important for cultivation of crops. The process of loosening and turning of the soil is called tilling or ploughing. This is done by using a plough. Ploughs are made of wood or iron. If the soil is very dry, it may need watering before ploughing. The ploughed field may have big clumps of soil called crumbs. It is necessary to break these crumbs. Levelling the field is beneficial for sowing as well as for irrigation. Levelling of soil is done with the help of a leveller. Sometimes, manure is added to the soil before tilling. This helps in proper mixing of manure with soil. The soil is moistened before sowing. Agricultural Implements Before sowing the seeds, it is necessary to break soil clumps to get better yield."}

Plough : This is being used since ancient times for tilling the soil, adding fertilisers to the crop, removing the weeds and turning the soil. This is made of wood and is drawn by a pair of bulls or other animals (horses and camels). It contains a strong triangular iron strip called ploughshare. The main part of the plough is a long log of wood which is called a ploughshaft. There is a handle at one end of the shaft. The other end is attached to a beam which is placed on the bulls\u2019 necks. One pair of bulls and a man can easily operate the plough [Fig. 1.1 (a)]. The indigenous wooden plough is increasingly being replaced by iron ploughs nowadays. Hoe : It is a simple tool which is used for removing weeds and for loosening the soil.

Sowing by using a seed drill saves time and labour. Fig. 1.2 (b) : A seed drill There is a nursery near my school. I found that little plants were kept in small bags. Why are they kept like this?

Why do some plants grow better than others? sufficient sunlight, nutrients and water from the soil. At times a few plants may have to be removed to prevent overcrowding. 1.5 Adding Manure and Fertilisers The substances which are added to the soil in the form of nutrients for the healthy growth of plants are called manure and fertilisers. Soil supplies mineral nutrients to the crop plants. These nutrients are essential for the growth of plants. In certain areas, farmers grow crop after crop in the same field. The field is never left uncultivated or fallow. Imagine what happens to the nutrients? Continuous cultivation of crops makes the soil poor in nutrients. Therefore, farmers have to add manure to the fields to replenish the soil with nutrients. This process is called manuring. Improper or insufficient manuring results in weak plants. Manure is an organic substance obtained from the decomposition of plant or animal wastes. Farmers dump plant and animal waste in pits at open places and allow it to decompose. The decomposition is caused by some microorganisms. The decomposed matter is used as organic manure. You have already learnt about vermicomposting in Class VI. 2024-25 SCIENCE 6 Activity 1.2 Take moong or gram seeds and germinate them. Select three equal sized seedlings.

How are they different from manure? Fertilisers are produced in factories. Some examples of fertilisers are\u2014 urea, ammonium sulphate, super phosphate, potash, NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium). The use of fertilisers has helped farmers to get better yield of crops such as wheat, paddy and maize. But excessive use of fertilisers has made the soil less fertile. Fertilisers have also become a source of water pollution. Therefore, in order to maintain the fertility of the soil, we have to substitute fertilisers with organic manure or leave the field uncultivated (fallow) in between two crops. The use of manure improves soil texture as well as its water retaining capacity. It replenishes the soil with nutrients. Another method of replenishing the soil with nutrients is through crop rotation. This can be done by growing different crops alternately. Earlier, farmers in northern India used to grow legumes as fodder in one season and wheat in the next season. This helped in the replenishment of the soil with nitrogen. Farmers are being encouraged to adopt this practice. In the previous classes, you have learnt about Rhizobium bacteria. These are present in the nodules of roots of leguminous plants. They fix atmospheric nitrogen. Fig. 1.3 (a) : Preparation of the experiment Did plants in all the glasses grow at the same pace? Which glass showed Fig."}

Advantages of Manure : The organic manure is considered better than fertilisers. This is because l it enhances the water holding capacity of the soil. l it makes the soil porous due to which exchange of gases becomes easy. l it increases the number of friendly microbes. l it improves the texture of the soil. 1.6 Irrigation All living beings need water to live. Water is important for proper growth and development. Water is absorbed by the plant roots. Along with water, minerals and fertilisers are also absorbed. Plants contain nearly 90% water. Water is essential because germination of seeds does not take place under dry conditions. Nutrients dissolved in water are transported to each part of the plant. Water also protects the crop from both frost and hot air currents. To maintain the moisture of the soil for healthy crop growth, fields have to be watered regularly. The supply of water to crops at regular intervals is called irrigation. The time and frequency of irrigation varies from crop to crop, soil to soil and season to season. In summer, the frequency of watering is higher. Why is it so? Could it be due to the increased rate of evaporation of water from the soil and the leaves?

Cattle or human labour is used in these methods. So these methods are cheaper, but less efficient. The various traditional ways are: (i) moat (pulley-system) (ii) chain pump (iii) dhekli, and (iv) rahat (Lever system) [Figs. 1.4 (a)- (d)]. Pumps are commonly used for lifting water. Diesel, biogas, electricity and solar energy is used to run these pumps. 2024-25 CROP PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT 9 Modern Methods of Irrigation Modern methods of irrigation help us to use water economically. The main methods used are as follows: (i) Sprinkler System: This system is more useful on the uneven land where sufficient water is not available. The perpendicular pipes, having rotating nozzles on top, are joined to the main pipeline at regular intervals. When water is allowed to flow through the main pipe under pressure with the help of a pump, it escapes from the rotating nozzles. It gets sprinkled on the crop as if it is raining. Sprinkler is very useful for lawns, coffee plantation and several other crops [Fig. 1.5 (a)]. Fig. 1.5 (b) : Drip System Fig."}

So it is called drip system. It is the best technique for watering fruit plants, gardens and trees [Fig. 1.5(b)]. Water is not wasted at all. It is a boon in regions where availability of water is poor. 2024-25 SCIENCE 10 1.7 Protection from Weeds Boojho and Paheli went to a nearby wheat field and saw that there were some other plants in the field, growing along with wheat plants. Have these other plants been planted purposely? In a field many other undesirable plants may grow naturally along with the crop. These undesirable plants are called weeds. The removal of weeds is called weeding. Weeding is necessary since weeds compete with the crop plants for water, nutrients, space and light. Thus, they affect the growth of the crop. Some weeds interfere even in harvesting and may be poisonous for animals and human beings. Farmers adopt many ways to remove weeds and control their growth. Tilling before sowing of crops helps in uprooting and killing of weeds, which may then dry up and get mixed with the soil. The best time for the removal of weeds is before they produce flowers and seeds. The manual removal includes physical removal of weeds by uprooting or cutting them close to the ground, from time to time. This is done with the help of a khurpi. A seed drill [Fig. 1.2(b)] is also used to uproot weeds. Weeds are also controlled by using certain chemicals, called weedicides, like 2,4-D. These are sprayed in the fields to kill the weeds. They do not damage the crops."}

Do weedicides have any effect on the person handling the weedicide sprayer? Fig. 1.6 : Spraying weedicide As already mentioned, the weedicides are sprayed during the vegetative growth of weeds before flowering and seed formation. Spraying of weedicides may affect the health of farmers. So they should use these chemicals very carefully. They should cover their nose and mouth with a piece of cloth during spraying of these chemicals. 1.8 Harvesting Harvesting of a crop is an important task. The cutting of crop after it is mature is called harvesting. In harvesting, crops are pulled out or cut close to the ground. It usually takes 3 to 4 months for a cereal crop to mature. Harvesting in our country is either done manually by sickle (Fig. 1.7) or by a machine called harvester. In the harvested crop, the grain seeds need to be separated Fig. 1.7 : Sickle 2024-25 CROP PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT 11 from the chaff. This process is called threshing. This is carried out with the help of a machine called \u2018combine\u2019 which is in fact a harvester as well as a thresher (Fig. 1.8). Fig. 1.8 : Combine After harvesting, sometimes stubs are left in the field, which are burnt by farmers. Paheli is worried. She knows that it causes pollution. It may also catch fire and damage the crops lying in the fields. Harvest Festivals After three or four months of hard work there comes the day of the harvest. The sight of golden fields of standing crop, laden with grain, fills the hearts of farmers with joy and a sense of well-being."}

The period of harvest is, thus, of great joy and happiness in all parts of India. Men and women celebrate it with great enthusiasm. Special festivals associated with the harvest season are Pongal, Baisakhi, Holi, Diwali, Nabanya and Bihu. 1.9 Storage Storage of produce is an important task. If the harvested grains are to be kept for longer time, they should be safe from moisture, insects, rats and microorganisms. Harvested grains have more moisture. If freshly harvested grains (seeds) are stored without drying, they may get spoilt or attacked by organisms, making them unfit for use or for germination. Hence, before storing them, the grains are properly dried in the sun to reduce the moisture in them. This prevents the attack by insect pests, bacteria and fungi. Farmers with small holdings of land do the separation of grain and chaff by winnowing (Fig. 1.9). You have already studied this in Class VI.

These observations show that water and soil are full of tiny organisms, though not all of them fall into the category of microbes. These microorganisms or microbes are so small in size that they cannot be seen with the unaided eye. Some of these, such as the fungus that grows on bread, can be seen with a magnifying glass.

Commercial Use of Microorganisms Microorganisms are used for the large scale production of alcohol, wine and acetic acid (vinegar). Yeast is used for commercial production of alcohol and wine. For this purpose yeast is grown on natural sugars present in grains like barley, wheat, rice, crushed fruit juices, etc. Activity 2.4 Take a 500 mL beaker filled upto \u00be with water.

The source of these medicines is microorganisms. These medicines kill or stop the growth of the disease-causing microorganisms. Such medicines are called antibiotics. These days a number of antibiotics are being produced from bacteria and fungi. Streptomycin, tetracycline and erythromycin are some of the 2024-25 MICROORGANISMS : FRIEND AND FOE 21 commonly known antibiotics which are made from fungi and bacteria. The antibiotics are manufactured by growing specific microorganisms and are used to cure a variety of diseases. Antibiotics are even mixed with the feed of livestock and poultry to check microbial infection in animals. They are also used to control many plant diseases. It is important to remember that antibiotics should be taken only on the advice of a qualified doctor. Also you must complete the course prescribed by the doctor."}

Vaccine from the disease-causing microbes for ever. This is how a vaccine works. Several diseases, including cholera, tuberculosis, smallpox and hepatitis can be prevented by vaccination. Edward Jenner discovered the vaccine for small- pox in 1798. Why are children/infants given vaccination? When a disease-carrying microbe enters our body, the body produces antibodies to fight the invader. The body also remembers how to fight the microbe if it enters again. If dead or weakened microbes are introduced into a healthy body, the body fights and kills the invading bacteria by producing suitable antibodies. The antibodies remain in the body and we are protected In your childhood, you must have been given injections to protect yourself against several diseases. Can you prepare a list of these diseases? You may take help from your parents. It is essential to protect all children against these diseases. Necessary vaccines are available in the nearby hospitals. You might have seen the advertisement on TV and newspapers regarding protection of children against polio under the Pulse Polio Programme. Polio drops given to children are actually a vaccine. A worldwide campaign against smallpox has finally led to its eradication from most parts of the world. These days vaccines are made on a large scale from microorganisms to protect humans and other animals from several diseases.

Along with their friends, they collected wastes of plants, vegetables and fruits from nearby houses and gardens. They put them in a pit meant for waste disposal. After some time, it decomposed and got converted to manure. Boojho and Paheli wanted to know how this had happened. Activity 2.5 Take two pots and fill each pot half with soil. Mark them A and B. Put plant waste in pot A and things like polythene bags, empty glass bottles and broken plastic toys in pot B. Put the pots aside. Observe them after 3-4 weeks. Do you find any difference in the contents of the two pots? If so, what is the difference? You will find that plant waste in pot A, has been decomposed. How did this happen? The plant waste has been converted into manure by the action of microbes. The nutrients released in the process can be used by the plants again. Did you notice that in pot B, the polythene bags, empty glasses, bottles and broken toy parts did not undergo any such change? The microbes could not \u2018act\u2019 on them and convert them into manure. You often see large amounts of dead organic matter in the form of decaying plants and sometimes dead animals on the ground. You find that they disappear after some time. This is because the microorganisms decompose dead organic waste of plants and animals converting them into simple substances. These substances are again used by other plants and animals. Thus, microorganisms can be used to degrade the harmful and smelly substances and thereby clean up the environment. 2.4 Harmful Microorganisms Microorganisms are harmful in many ways."}

Some microorganisms spoil food, clothing and leather. Let us study more about their harmful activities. Disease causing Microorganisms in Humans Pathogens enter our body through the air we breathe, the water we drink or the food we eat. They can also get transmitted by direct contact with an infected person or carried by an animal. Microbial diseases that can spread from an infected person to a healthy person through air, water, food or physical contact are called communicable diseases. Examples of such diseases include cholera, common cold, chicken pox and tuberculosis. When a person suffering from common cold sneezes, fine droplets of moisture carrying thousands of viruses are spread in the air. The virus may enter the body of a healthy person while breathing and cause infection. There are some insects and animals which act as carriers of disease- causing microbes. Housefly is one such carrier. The flies sit on the garbage and animal excreta. Pathogens stick to their bodies. When these flies sit on uncovered food they may transfer the pathogens. Whoever eats the contaminated food is likely to get sick. So, it is advisable to always keep food covered. Avoid consuming uncovered items of food. Another example of a carrier is the female Anopheles mosquito (Fig. 2.8), which carries the parasite of malaria (Plasmodium). Female Aedes mosquito acts as carrier of dengue virus. How can we control the spread of malaria or dengue? Then how do you prevent the spread of communicable diseases? We should keep a handkerchief on the nose and mouth while sneezing."}

So, it is very important that we preserve food to prevent it from being spoilt. 2.5 Food Preservation In Chapter 1, we have learnt about the methods used to preserve and store food grains. How do we preserve cooked food at home? You know that bread left unused under moist conditions is attacked by fungus. Microorganisms spoil our food. Spoiled food emits bad smell and has a bad taste and changed colour. Is spoiling of food a chemical reaction? Paheli bought some mangoes but she could not eat them for a few days.

Chemical Method Salts and edible oils are the common chemicals generally used to check the growth of microorganisms. Therefore they are called preservatives. We add salt or acid preservatives to pickles to prevent the attack of microbes. Sodium benzoate and sodium metabisulphite are common preservatives. These are also used in jams and squashes to check their spoilage. Preservation by Common Salt Common salt has been used to preserve meat and fish for ages. Meat and fish are covered with dry salt to check the growth of bacteria. Salting is also used to preserve amla, raw mangoes, tamarind, etc. Preservation by Sugar Jams, jellies and squashes are preserved by sugar. Sugar reduces the moisture content which inhibits the growth of bacteria which spoil food. Preservation by Oil and Vinegar Use of oil and vinegar prevents spoilage of pickles because bacteria cannot live in such an environment. Vegetables, fruits, fish and meat are often preserved by this method. Heat and Cold Treatments You must have observed your mother boiling milk before it is stored or used. Boiling kills many microorganisms. Similarly, we keep our food in the refrigerator. Low temperature inhibits the growth of microbes. Pasteurised milk can be consumed without boiling as it is free from harmful microbes. The milk is heated to about 700C for 15 to 30 seconds and then suddenly chilled and stored. By doing so, it prevents the growth of microbes. This process was discovered by Louis Pasteur. It is called pasteurisation. Storage and Packing These days dry fruits and even vegetables are sold in sealed air tight packets to prevent the attack of microbes. 2.6 Nitrogen Fixation You have learnt about the bacterium Rhizobium in Classes VI and VII."}

Let us understand this in the next section. Why does the milk that comes in packets not spoil? My mother told me that the milk is \u2018pasteurised\u2019. What is pasteurisation? 2024-25 MICROORGANISMS : FRIEND AND FOE 27 nitrogen cannot be taken directly by plants and animals. Certain bacteria and blue green algae present in the soil fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into compounds of nitrogen. Once nitrogen is converted into these usable compounds, it can be utilised by plants from the soil through their root system. Nitrogen is then used for the synthesis of plant proteins and other compounds. Animals feeding on plants get these proteins and other nitrogen compounds (Fig. 2.10). When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi present in the soil convert the nitrogenous wastes into nitrogenous compounds to be used by plants again. Certain other bacteria convert some part of them to nitrogen gas which goes back into the atmosphere. As a result, the percentage of nitrogen in the atmosphere remains more or less constant. Fig. 2.10 : Nitrogen cycle Fig. 2.9 : Roots of a leguminous plant with root nodules 2.7 Nitrogen cycle Our atmosphere has 78% nitrogen gas.

Are the earlier generations of any group too greedy? It may be that the earlier generations in some groups were concerned about the coming generation(s) and left something for them. In this chapter we will learn about some exhaustible natural resources like coal, petroleum and natural gas. These were formed from the dead remains of living organisms (fossils). So, these are all known as fossil fuels. 3.1 Coal You may have seen coal or heard about it (Fig. 3.1). It is as hard as stone and is black in colour. Fig. 3.1: Coal Coal is one of the fuels used to cook food. Earlier, it was used in railway engines to produce steam to run the engine. It is also used in thermal power plants to produce electricity. Coal is also used as a fuel in various industries. Story of Coal Where do we get coal from and how is it formed? About 300 million years ago the earth had dense forests in low lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes, like flooding, these forests got buried under the soil."}

It is used Coal gas was used for street lighting for the first time in London in 1810 and in New York around 1820. Now a days, it is used as a source of heat rather than light. These days, bitumen, a petroleum product, is used in place of coal-tar for metalling the roads. Fig. 3.3: Coal tar When heated in air, coal burns and produces mainly carbon dioxide gas. Coal is processed in industry to get some useful products such as coke, coal tar and coal gas. Coke It is a tough, porous and black substance. It is an almost pure form of carbon. Coke is used in the manufacture of steel and in the extraction of many metals. Coal Tar It is a black, thick liquid (Fig. 3.3) with an unpleasant smell. It is a mixture of about 200 substances. Products obtained from coal tar are used as starting materials for manufacturing various substances used in everyday life and in industry, like synthetic dyes, drugs, explosives, perfumes, plastics, paints, photographic materials, roofing materials, etc. Interestingly, naphthalene balls used to repel moths and other insects are also obtained from coal tar."}

It required the dead organisms millions of years to get converted into these fuels. On the other hand, the known reserves of these will last only a few hundred years. Moreover, burning of these fuels is a major cause of air pollution. Their use is also linked to global warming. It is therefore necessary that we use these fuels only when absolutely necessary. This will result in better environment, smaller risk of global warming and their availability for a longer period of time. In India, the Petroleum Conservation Research Association (PCRA) advises people how to save petrol/diesel while driving. Their tips are l drive at a constant and moderate speed as far as possible, l switch off the engine at traffic lights or at a place where you have to wait, l ensure correct tyre pressure. l ensure regular maintenance of the vehicle.

Can you name a few fuels used in our homes? Name a few fuels used in trade and industry. What fuels are used for running automobiles? Your list will contain fuels like cowdung, wood, coal, charcoal, petrol, diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), etc. You are familiar with the burning of a candle. What is the difference between the burning of a candle and the burning of a fuel like coal? May be you were able to guess right: candle burns with a flame whereas coal does not. Similarly, you will find many other materials burning without a flame. Let us study the chemical process of burning and the types of flame produced during this process. 4.1 What is Combustion? Recall the activity of burning of magnesium ribbon performed in Class VII. We learnt that magnesium burns to form magnesium oxide and produces heat and light (Fig. 4.1). We can perform a similar activity with a piece of charcoal. Hold the piece with a pair of tongs and bring it near the flame of a candle or a Bunsen burner. What do you observe? We find that charcoal burns in air."}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 38, "content": "We know that coal, too, burns in air producing carbon dioxide, heat and light. We were told that food is a fuel for our body. Fig. 4.1 : Burning of magnesium A chemical process in which a substance reacts with oxygen to give off heat is called combustion. The substance that undergoes combustion is said to be combustible. It is also called a fuel. The fuel may be solid, liquid or gas. Sometimes, light is also given off during combustion, either as a flame or as a glow. In the reactions mentioned above magnesium and charcoal are combustible substances. 2024-25 Activity 4.2 (Caution : Be careful while handling burning candle). Fix a lighted candle on a table. Put a glass chimney over the candle and rest it on a few wooden blocks in such a way that air can enter the Table 4.1 : Combustible and Non- combustible Substances Material Combustible Non- combustible Wood Paper Iron nails Kerosene oil Stone piece Straw Charcoal Matchsticks Glass Activity 4.1 Collect some materials like straw, matchsticks, kerosene oil, paper, iron nails, stone pieces, glass etc. Under the supervision of your teacher try to burn each of these materials one by one. If combustion takes place mark the material combustible, otherwise mark it non-combustible (Table 4.1). (a) (b) (c) Fig. 4.2: Experiment to show that air is essential for burning Rightly so.

What happens in the three cases? Does the flame flicker off? Does it flicker and give smoke? Does it burn unaffected? Can you infer anything at all about the role played by air in the process of burning? We find that for combustion, air is necessary. The candle burns freely in case (a) when air can enter the chimney from below. In case (b), when air does not enter the chimney from below, the flame flickers and produces smoke. In case (c), the flame finally goes off because the air is not available. 2024-25 SCIENCE 42 Activity 4.3 Place a piece of burning wood or charcoal on an iron plate or Tawa. Cover it with a glass jar or a tumbler, or a transparent plastic jar. Observe what happens. Does charcoal stop burning after sometime? Can you think of the reason why it stops burning? You might have heard that when the clothes of a person catch fire, the person We have read that the sun produces its own heat and light. Is it also some kind of combustion? In the sun, heat and light are produced by nuclear reactions. You will learn about this process in higher classes. During extreme heat of summer, at some places dry grass catches fire. From the grass, it spreads to trees, and very soon the whole forest is on fire (Fig. 4.4). It is very difficult to control such fires. Fig. 4.4 : Forest fire Fig. 4.3 : Blanket wrapped around a person whose clothes caught fire Now recall some of your experiences. Does a matchstick burn by itself? How does it burn?"}

Have you heard of forest fires? is covered with a blanket to extinguish fire (Fig. 4.3). Can you guess why? 2024-25 COMBUSTION AND FLAME 43 We find that a combustible substance cannot catch fire or burn as long as its temperature is lower than its ignition temperature. Have you ever seen cooking oil catching fire when a frying pan is kept for long on a burning stove? Kerosene oil and wood do not catch fire on their own at room temperature. But, if kerosene oil is heated a little, it will catch fire. But if wood is heated a little, it would still not catch fire. Does it mean that ignition temperature of kerosene oil is lower than that of wood? Does it mean that we need to take special care in storing kerosene oil? The following activity shows that it is essential for a substance to reach ignition temperature to burn. Activity 4.4 (Caution : Be careful while handling burning candle). Make two paper cups by folding a sheet of paper. Pour about 50 mL of water in one of the cups. Heat both the cups separately with a candle (Fig. 4.5). What do you observe? The history of the matchstick is very old. More than five thousand years ago small pieces of pinewood dipped in sulphur were used as matches in ancient Egypt. The modern safety match was developed only about two hundred years ago."}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 41, "content": "A mixture of antimony trisulphide, potassium chlorate and white phosphorus with some glue and starch was applied on the head of a match made of suitable wood. When struck against a rough surface, white phosphorus got ignited due to the heat of friction. This started the combustion of the match. However, white phosphorus proved to be dangerous both for the workers involved in the manufacturing of matches and for the users. These days the head of the safety match contains only antimony trisulphide and potassium chlorate. The rubbing surface has powdered glass and a little red phosphorus (which is much less dangerous). When the match is struck against the rubbing surface, some red phosphorus gets converted into white phosphorus. This immediately reacts with potassium chlorate in the matchstick head to produce enough heat to ignite antimony trisulphide and start the combustion. Do these experiences tell you that different substances catch fire at different temperatures? The lowest temperature at which a substance catches fire is called its ignition temperature. Can you tell now why a matchstick does not catch fire on its own at room temperature? Why does the matchstick start burning on rubbing it on the side of the matchbox? Fig. 4.5 : Heating water in a paper cup water paper cups What happens to the empty paper cup? What happens to the paper cup with water? Does water in this cup become hot? 2024-25 SCIENCE 44 If we continue heating the cup, we can even boil water in the paper cup. Can you think of an explanation for this phenomenon? The heat supplied to the paper cup is transferred to water by conduction. So, in the presence of water, the ignition temperature of paper is not reached. Hence, it does not burn."}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 42, "content": "The substances which have very low ignition temperature and can easily catch fire with a flame are called inflammable substances. Examples of inflammable substances are petrol, alcohol, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) etc. Can you list some more inflammable substances? 4.2 How Do We Control Fire? You must have seen or heard of fire breaking out in homes, shops and factories. If you have seen such an accident, write a short description in your note book. Also, share the experience with your classmates. It is important that all of us know the telephone numbers of the fire service. Fig. 4.6: Firemen extinguish the fire by throwing water under pressure Find out the telephone number of the fire service in your area. If a fire breaks out in your house or in your neighbourhood, the first thing to do is to call the fire service. Does your city/town have a fire brigade station? When a fire brigade arrives, what does it do? It pours water on the fire (Fig. 4.6). Water cools the combustible material so that its temperature is brought below its ignition temperature. This prevents the fire from spreading. Water vapours also surround the combustible material, helping in cutting off the supply of air. So, the fire is extinguished. You have learnt that there are three essential requirements for producing fire. Can you list these requirements? These are: fuel, air (to supply oxygen) and heat (to raise the temperature of the fuel beyond the ignition temperature). Fire can be controlled by removing one or more of these requirements. The job of a fire extinguisher is to cut off the supply of air, or to bring down the temperature of the fuel, or both. Notice that the fuel 2024-25 COMBUSTION AND FLAME 45 The most common fire extinguisher is water."}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 43, "content": "But water works only when things like wood and paper are on fire. If electrical equipment is on fire, water may conduct electricity and harm those trying to douse the fire. Water is also not suitable for fires involving oil and petrol. Do you recall that water is heavier than oil? So, it sinks below the oil, and oil keeps burning on the top. For fires involving electrical equipment and inflammable materials like petrol, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best extinguisher. CO2, being heavier than oxygen, covers the fire like a blanket. Since the contact between the fuel and oxygen is cut off, the fire is controlled. The added advantage of CO2 is that in most cases it does not harm the electrical equipment. How do we get the supply of carbon dioxide? It can be stored at high pressure as a liquid in cylinders. In what form is the LPG stored in cylinders? When released from the cylinder, CO2 expands enormously in volume and cools down. So, it not only forms a blanket around the fire, it also brings down the temperature of the fuel. That is why it is an excellent fire extinguisher. Another way to get CO2 is to release a lot of dry powder of chemicals like sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate. Near the fire, these chemicals give off CO2. CAUTION : Do not handle the gas stove yourself. Ask your parents to help. Fig. 4.7 : Fire extinguisher in most cases cannot be eliminated. If, for instance, a building catches fire, the whole building is the fuel. 4.3 Types of Combustion Bring a burning matchstick or a gas lighter near a gas stove in the kitchen. Turn on the knob of the gas stove. What do you observe?"}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 44, "content": "We find that the gas burns rapidly and produces heat and light. Such combustion is known as rapid combustion. There are substances like phosphorus which burn in air at room temperature. The type of combustion in which a material suddenly bursts into flames, without the application of any apparent cause is called spontaneous combustion. 2024-25 SCIENCE 46 Spontaneous combustion of coal dust has resulted in many disastrous fires in coal mines. Spontaneous forest fires are sometimes due to the heat of the sun or due to lightning strike. However, most forest fires are due to the carelessness of human beings. It is important to remember that the campfires must be completely extinguished before leaving a forest after a picnic, or a visit. We generally have fireworks on festival days. When a cracker is ignited, a sudden reaction takes place with the evolution of heat, light and sound. A large amount of gas formed in the reaction is liberated. Such a reaction is called explosion. Explosion can also take place if pressure is applied on the cracker. 4.4 Flame Observe an LPG flame. Can you tell the colour of the flame. What is the colour of a candle flame? Recall your experience of burning a magnesium ribbon in Class VII. If you do not have experience of burning the remaining items in Table 4.2 you can do that now.

Bring a lighted matchstick near the other end of the glass tube. Do you see a flame caught at this end of the glass tube after a while? If so, what is it that produces a flame? Notice that the wax near the heated wick melts quickly. The substances which vapourise during burning, give flames. For example, kerosene oil and molten wax rise through the wick and are vapourised during burning and form flames. Charcoal, on the other hand, does not vapourise and so does not produce a flame. In Activity 4.5, could the vapours of wax coming out of the glass tube be the cause of the flame produced? Fig. 4.10 Fig. 4.12 When the candle flame is steady, introduce a clean glass plate/slide into the luminous zone of the flame (Fig. 4.11). Hold it there with a pair of tongs for about 10 seconds.

{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 46, "content": "Recall that the sources of heat energy for domestic and industrial purposes are mainly wood, charcoal, petrol, kerosene etc. These substances are called fuels. A good fuel is one which is readily available. It is cheap. It burns easily in air at a moderate rate. It produces a large amount of heat. It does not leave behind any undersirable substances. There is probably no fuel that could be considered as an ideal fuel. We should look for a fuel which fulfils most of the requirements for a particular use. Fuels differ in their cost. Some fuels are cheaper than others. Make a list of fuels familiar to you. Group them as solid, liquid and gaseous fuels as in Table 4.3. 4.7 Fuel Efficiency Suppose you were asked to boil a given quantity of water using cow dung, coal and LPG as fuel. Which fuel would you prefer? Give your reason. You may take the help of your parents. Do these three fuels produce the same amount of heat? The amount of heat energy produced on complete combustion of 1 kg of a fuel is called its calorific value.

Incomplete combustion of these fuels gives carbon monoxide gas. It is a very poisonous gas. It is dangerous to burn coal in a closed room. The carbon monoxide gas produced can kill persons sleeping in that room. For centuries, wood was used as domestic and industrial fuel. But now it has been replaced by coal and other fuels like LPG. In many rural parts of our country, people still use wood as a fuel because of its easy availability and low cost. However, burning of wood gives a lot of smoke which is very harmful for human beings. It causes respiratory problem. Also, trees provide us with useful substances which are lost when wood is used as fuel. Moreover cutting of trees leads to deforestation which is quite harmful to the environment, as you learnt in Class VII.

This will lead to global warming as carbon dioxide traps the heat rays reflected by the earth. The increase in temperature on the earth disturbs the water cycle and may reduce rainfall. This could cause droughts. Deforestation is a major cause which leads to the change in soil properties. Physical properties of the soil get affected by plantation and vegetation. Fewer trees result in more soil erosion. Removal of the top layer of the soil exposes the lower, hard and rocky layers. This soil has less humus and is less fertile. Gradually the fertile land gets converted into deserts. It is called desertification. Deforestation also leads to a decrease in the water holding capacity of the soil. The movement of water from the soil surface into the ground (infiltration rate) is reduced. So, there are floods. The other properties of the soil like nutrient content, texture etc., also change because of deforestation. We have studied in Class VII that we get many products from forests. List these products.

Professor Ahmad explains that killing (poaching) or capturing animals in general is strictly prohibited and punishable by law in all such places. Wildlife Sanctuaries like reserve forests provide protection and suitable living conditions to wild animals. He also tells them that people living in wildlife sanctuaries are allowed to do certain activities such as grazing by their livestock, collecting medicinal plants, firewood, etc. instead of their natural habitat? In your opinion, will the animals be comfortable in a zoo or in their natural habitat? 5.8 National Park On the roadside there was another board on which was written \u2018Satpura National Park\u2019. Children are now eager to go there. Madhavji tells them that these reserves are large and diverse enough to protect whole sets of ecosystems. They preserve flora, fauna, landscape and historic objects of an area. Satpura National Park is the first Reserve Forest of India. The finest Indian teak is found in this forest. There are more than one hundred National Parks in India. It is a pity that even protected forests are not safe because people living in the neighbourhood encroach upon them and destroy them. Children are reminded of their visit to the zoo. They recall that zoos are also places where animals receive protection."}

Observe the conditions provided to the animals. Were they suitable for the animals? Can animals live in artificial setting Rock shelters are also found inside the Satpura National Park. These are evidences of prehistoric human life in these jungles. These give us an idea of the life of primitive people. Rock paintings are found in these shelters. A total of 55 rock shelters have been identified in Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve. Figures of animals and men fighting, hunting, dancing and playing musical instruments are depicted in these paintings. Many tribals still live in the area. As children move ahead, they see a board with \u2018Satpura Tiger Reserve\u2019 written on it. Madhavji explains that Project Tiger was launched by the government to protect the tigers in the country. The objective of this project was to ensure the survival and maintenance of the tiger population in the country. What is the difference between a zoo and a wildlife sanctuary? 2024-25 CONSERVATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 59 Are tigers still found in this forest? I hope I can see a tiger! Tiger (Fig. 5.4) is one of the many species which are slowly disappearing from our forests. But, the Satpura Tiger Reserve is unique in the sense that a significant increase in the population of tigers has been seen here.

Animals whose numbers are diminishing to a level that they might face extinction are known as the endangered animals. Boojho is reminded of the dinosaurs which became extinct a long time ago. Survival of some Fig. 5.5 : Wild buffalo Fig. 5.6 : Barasingha Are only big animals facing extinction? Madhavji tells Paheli that small animals are much more in danger of becoming extinct than the bigger animals. At times, we kill snakes, frogs, lizards, bats and owls ruthlessly without realising their importance in the ecosystem. By killing them we are harming ourselves. They might be small in size but their role in the ecosystem cannot be ignored. They form part of food chains and food webs.

He tells them that Red Data Book is the source book which keeps a record of all the endangered animals and plants. Red Data Book is maintained internationally by an organisation. India also maintains Red Data Book for plants and animals found in India. 5.10 Migration The excursion party then enters deeper into the forest under the guidance of Madhavji.

Madhavji tells the children that these are migratory birds. These birds have flown here from other parts of the world. Migratory birds fly to far away areas every year during a particular time because of climatic changes. They fly for laying eggs as the weather in their natural habitat becomes very cold and inhospitable. Birds who cover long distances to reach another land are known as migratory birds. 5.11 Recycling of Paper Professor Ahmad draws attention of the children to another cause of deforestation. He tells them that it takes 17 full grown trees to make one tonne of paper. Therefore, we should save paper. Professor Ahmad also tells that paper can be recycled five to seven times for use. If each student saves at least one sheet of paper in a day, we can save many trees in a year. We should save, reuse used paper and recycle it. By this we not only save trees but also save energy and water needed for manufacturing paper. Moreover, the amount of harmful chemicals used in paper making will also be reduced. I wonder if there is any record of all endangered species! 2024-25 CONSERVATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 61 5.12 Reforestation Professor Ahmad suggests that the answer to deforestation is reforestation. Reforestation is restocking of the destroyed forests by planting new trees. The planted trees should generally be of the same species which were found in that forest. We should plant at least as many trees as we cut."}

This act is aimed at preservation and conservation of natural forests and meeting the basic needs of the people living in or near the forests. After some rest Madhavji asks the children to start heading back because it is not advisable to stay in the jungle after sunset. On getting back, Professor Ahmad and the children thank Madhavji for guiding them through this exciting experience. 2024-25 SCIENCE 62 WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT \u00dc Wildlife sanctuary, national park and bio- sphere reserve are names given to the areas meant for conservation and preservation of forest and wild animals. \u00dc Biodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms in a specific area. \u00dc Plants and animals of a particular area are known as the flora and fauna of that area. \u00dc Endemic species are found only in a particular area. \u00dc Endangered species are those which are facing the danger of extinction. \u00dc Red Data Book contains a record of endangered species. \u00dc Migration is the phenomenon of movement of a species from its own habitat to some other habitat for a particular time period every year for a specific purpose like breeding. \u00dc We should save, reuse and recycle paper to save trees, energy and water."}

Try to name some of the young ones by completing Table 6.1 shown in examples at S. No. 1 and 5. You must have seen the young ones of various animals being born. Can you tell how chicks and caterpillars are born? How are kittens and puppies born? Do you think that these young ones looked the same before they were born as they do now? Let us find out. Just as in plants, there are two modes by which animals reproduce. These are: (i) Sexual reproduction, and (ii) Asexual reproduction. 6.2 Sexual Reproduction Try to recall reproduction in plants which you studied in Class VII. You will remember that plants that reproduce sexually have male and female reproductive parts. Can you name these parts? In animals also, males and females have different reproductive parts or organs. Like plants, the reproductive parts in animals also produce gametes that fuse to form a zygote. It is the zygote which develops into a new individual. This type of reproduction beginning from the fusion of male and female gametes is called sexual reproduction.

Though sperms are very small in size, each has a head, a middle piece and a tail. Does it appear to be a single cell? Indeed, each sperm is a single cell with all the usual cell components. Fig. 6.1: Male reproductive organs in humans What purpose does the tail in a sperm serve?

The egg may be very small as in humans, much larger as in hens. Ostrich egg is the largest! Fertilisation The first step in the process of reproduction is the fusion of a sperm and an ovum. When sperms come in contact with an egg, one of the sperms may fuse with the egg. Such fusion of the egg and the sperm is called fertilisation (Fig. 6.5). During fertilisation, the nuclei of the sperm and the egg fuse to form a single nucleus. This results in the formation of a fertilised egg or zygote (Fig. 6.6). Did Fig. 6.5 : Fertilisation Fig. 6.4 : Human Ovum Nucleus Sperms Ovum Fusing nuclei The process of fertilisation is the meeting of an egg cell from the mother and a sperm cell from the father."}

Internal fertilisation occurs in many animals including humans, cows, dogs and hens. Fig. 6.6 : Zygote female gametes called ova (eggs) (Fig. 6.4). In human beings, a single matured egg is released into the oviduct by one of the ovaries every month. Uterus is the part where development of the baby takes place. Like the sperm, an egg is also a single cell. you know that the zygote is the beginning of a new individual? 2024-25 REPRODUCTION IN ANIMALS 69 Why do fish and frogs lay eggs in hundreds whereas a hen lays only one egg at a time? Have you heard of test tube babies? Boojho and Paheli\u2019s teacher once told them in the class that in some women oviducts are blocked. These women are unable to bear babies because sperms cannot reach the egg for fertilisation. In such cases, doctors collect freshly released egg and sperms and keep them together for a few hours for IVF or in vitro fertilisation (fertilisation outside the body). In case fertilisation occurs, the zygote is allowed to develop for about a week and then it is placed in the mother\u2019s uterus. Complete development takes place in the uterus and the baby is born like any other baby. Babies born through this technique are called test-tube babies. This term is actually misleading because babies cannot grow in test tubes. female lays hundreds of eggs.

You will be surprised to know that in many animals fertilisation takes place outside the body of the female. In these animals, fertilisation takes place in water. Let us find out how this happens. Activity 6.1 Visit some ponds or slow-flowing streams during spring or rainy season. Look out for clusters of frog\u2019s eggs floating in water. Write down the colour and size of the eggs. During spring or rainy season, frogs and toads move to ponds and slow- flowing streams. When the male and female come together in water, the As the eggs are laid, the male deposits sperms over them. Each sperm swims randomly in water with the help of its long tail. The sperms come in contact with the eggs. This results in fertilisation. This type of fertilisation in which the fusion of a male and a female gamete takes place outside the body of the female is called external fertilisation. It is very common in aquatic animals such as fish, starfish, etc. Fig. 6.7 : Eggs of frog 2024-25 SCIENCE 70 Development of Embryo Fertilisation results in the formation of zygote which begins to develop into an embryo [Fig. 6.8(a)]. The zygote divides repeatedly to give rise to a ball of cells [Fig. 6.8(b)]. The cells then begin to form groups that develop into different tissues and organs of the body.

This is because the eggs and sperms get exposed to water movement, wind and rainfall. Also, there are other animals in the pond which may feed on eggs. Thus, production of large number of eggs and sperms is necessary to ensure fertilisation of at least a few of them. 2024-25 REPRODUCTION IN ANIMALS 71 parts such as hands, legs, head, eyes, ears etc. The stage of the embryo in which all the body parts can be identified is called a foetus (Fig. 6.9).

After the chick is completely developed it bursts open the egg shell. In animals which undergo external fertilisation, development of the embryo takes place outside the female body. The embryos continue to grow within their egg coverings. After the embryos develop, the eggs hatch. You must have seen numerous tadpoles swimming in ponds and streams. Viviparous and Oviparous Animals We have learnt that some animals give birth to young ones while some animals lay eggs which later develop into young ones. The animals which give birth to young ones are called viviparous animals. Those animals which lay eggs are called oviparous animals.

Then, how are chicks born? Let us find out. Soon after fertilisation, the zygote divides repeatedly and travels down the oviduct. As it travels down, many protective layers are formed around it. The hard shell that you see in a hen\u2019s egg is one such protective layer. After the hard shell is formed around the developing embryo, the hen finally lays the egg.

Observe live hydra yourself and learn how they reproduce by doing the following activity: During the summer months collect water weeds from ponds or ditches along with the pond water and put them in a glass jar. After a day or so you may see several hydra clinging to the sides of the jar. Hydra is transparent, jelly-like and with tentacles. It clings to the jar with the base of its body. If the jar is shaken, the hydra will contract instantly into a small blob, at the same time drawing its tentacles in. Now take out few hydras from the jar and put them on a watch glass. Using a hand lens or a binocular or dissection microscope, observe the changes that are taking place in their body. Note down your observations. 3. The eggs we get from the market are generally the unfertilised ones. In case you wish to observe a developing chick embryo, get a fertilised egg from the poultry or hatchery which has been incubated for 36 hours or more.

An interesting organisation is observed in a honey bee hive, a colony of several thousand bees. Only one bee in the colony lays eggs. This bee is called the queen bee. All other female bees are worker bees. Their main job is to build the hive, look after the young and feed the queen bee adequately to keep her healthy so that she can lay eggs. A queen bee lays thousands of eggs. The fertilised eggs hatch into females, while the unfertilised eggs give rise to males, called drones. It is the job of the worker bees to maintain the temperature of the hive at around 35\u00b0C to incubate the eggs. 2024-25 I n the previous chapter, you have learnt how animals reproduce. It is only after \u2018growing up\u2019 to a certain age that human beings and many other animals can reproduce. Why can humans reproduce only after a certain age? In this chapter, you will learn about changes that take place in the human body after which a person becomes capable of reproduction. In Chapter 6, you have learnt about human reproductive organs. Here, we shall discuss the role that hormones play in bringing about changes that make a child grow into an adult. 7.1 Adolescence and Puberty Boojho was celebrating his 12th birthday. After his friends left, Boojho and Paheli began chatting with their parents. Paheli studies in an all-girls school. She started laughing. She remarked that many of Boojho\u2019s school friends, whom she met after a year, had suddenly shot up in height."}

They indicate that you are I wonder how long this period marked by changes in the body will last! no longer a child but are on the way to becoming an adult. It is a strange period of life when you are neither a child nor an adult. I wonder whether this period between childhood and adulthood had a special name! Growing up is a natural process. The period of life, when the body undergoes changes, leading to reproductive maturity, is called adolescence. Adolescence begins around the age of 11 and lasts upto 18 or 19 years of age. Since this period covers the \u2018teens\u2019 (13 to 18 or 19 years of age), adolescents are also called \u2018teenagers\u2019. In girls, adolescence may begin a year or two earlier than in boys. Also, the period of adolescence varies from person to person. The human body undergoes several changes during adolescence. These changes mark the onset of puberty. The most important change which marks puberty is that boys and girls become capable of reproduction. Puberty ends when an adolescent reaches reproductive maturity."}

They wanted to know more about other changes at puberty. 7.2 Changes at Puberty Increase in Height The most conspicuous change during puberty is the sudden increase in height. At this time the long bones, that is, the bones of the arms and the legs elongate and make a person tall. Activity 7.1 The following chart gives the average rate of growth in height of boys and girls with age. The figures in columns 2 and 3, give the percentage of the height a person has reached at the age given in column 1. For example, by the age 11, a boy has reached 81% of his probable full height, while a girl has reached 88% of her full height.

Sometimes the arms and legs or hands and feet of adolescents look oversized and out of proportion with the body. But soon the other parts catch up and result in a proportionate body. You must have noticed that height of an individual is more or less similar to that of some family member. This is because height depends on the genes inherited from parents. It is, however, very important to eat the right kind of food during these growing years. This helps the bones, muscles and other parts of the body get adequate nourishment for growth. You will find nutritional needs of adolescents discussed later in the lesson. Change in Body Shape Have you noticed that boys in your class have broader shoulders and wider chests than boys in junior classes? This is because they have entered the age of puberty when shoulders generally broaden as a result of growth. In girls, the region below the waist becomes wider. In boys, the muscles of the body grow more prominently than in the girls. Thus, changes occurring in adolescent boys and girls are different. Voice Change Did you notice that sometimes the voice of some of the boys in your class cracks? At puberty, the voice box or the larynx begins to grow. Boys develop larger voice boxes. The growing voice box in boys can be seen as a protruding part of the throat Activity 7.2 Use the data given in Activity 7.1 to draw a graph.

Development of Sex Organs Look up Fig. 6.1 and 6.3 of the previous lesson which show sex organs of humans. At puberty, male sex organs like the testes and penis develop completely. The testes also begin to produce sperms. In girls, the ovaries enlarge and eggs begin to mature. Also ovaries start releasing mature eggs. Reaching Mental, Intellectual and Emotional Maturity Adolescence is also a period of change in a person\u2019s way of thinking. Adolescents are more independent than before and are also self conscious. Intellectual development takes place and they tend to spend considerable time thinking. In fact, it is often the time in one\u2019s life when the brain has the greatest capacity for learning. Sometimes, however, an adolescent may feel insecure while trying to adjust to the changes in the body and mind. But as adolescent learners, you should know that there is no reason to feel insecure. These changes are a natural part of growing up. 7.3 Secondary Sexual Characters You have learnt in Chapter 6, that testes and ovaries are the reproductive organs."}

In girls, breasts begin to develop at puberty Many of my classmates have a hoarse voice. Now I know why? Fig. 7.2 : Adam\u2019s apple in a grown up boy called Adam\u2019s apple (Fig. 7.2). In girls, the larynx is hardly visible from the outside because of its small size. Generally, girls have a high pitched voice, whereas boys have a deep voice. In adolescent boys, sometimes, the muscles of the growing voice box go out of control and the voice becomes hoarse. This state may remain for a few days or weeks after which the voice becomes normal. A few glands such as sweat glands, oil glands and salivary glands release their secretions through ducts. Endocrine glands release hormones directly into the bloodstream. So, they are also termed ductless glands. Increased Activity of Sweat and Sebaceous Glands During puberty the secretion of sweat glands and sebaceous glands (oil glands) increases. Many young people get acne Adam\u2019s apple 2024-25 REACHING THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 83 and boys begin to grow facial hair, that is, moustaches and beard. As these features help to distinguish the male from the female they are called secondary sexual characters. Boys also develop hair on their chest. In both, boys and girls, hair grows under the arms and in the region above the thighs or the pubic region. Paheli and Boojho have now understood that puberty marks the beginning of the reproductive period when one becomes capable of reproduction. But they want to know if reproductive life, once begun, continues, or it ends some time. The testes and ovaries secrete sex hormones. You have just learnt that these hormones are responsible for the male and female secondary sexual characters."}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 82, "content": "Further, the sex hormones are under the control of hormones from the pituitary gland (Fig. 7.3). The pituitary secretes many hormones, one of which makes ova mature in the ovaries and sperms form in the testes. Both Boojho and Paheli wish to know what initiates changes at puberty. Fig. 7.3 : The onset of puberty is controlled by hormones The changes which occur at adolescence are controlled by hormones. Hormones are chemical substances. These are secretions from endocrine glands, or endocrine system. The male hormone or testosterone begins to be released by the testes at the onset of puberty. This causes changes in boys about which you have just learnt, for example, the growth of facial hair. Once puberty is reached in girls, ovaries begin to produce the female hormone or estrogen which makes the breasts develop. Milk secreting glands or mammary glands develop inside the breasts. The production of these hormones is under the control of another hormone secreted from an endocrine gland called pituitary gland. 7.4 Role of Hormones in Initiating Reproductive Function Endocrine glands release hormones into the bloodstream to reach a particular body part called target site. The target site responds to the hormone. There are many endocrine glands or ductless glands in the body. 2024-25 SCIENCE 84 7.5 Reproductive Phase of Life in Humans Adolescents become capable of reproduction when their testes and ovaries begin to produce gametes. The capacity for maturation and production of gametes lasts for a much longer time in males than in females. In females, the reproductive phase of life begins at puberty (10 to 12 years of age) and generally lasts till the age of approximately 45 to 50 years. The ova begin to mature with the onset of puberty."}

During this period, the wall of the uterus becomes thick so as to receive the egg, in case it is fertilised and begins to develop. This results in pregnancy. If fertilisation does not occur, the released egg, and the thickened lining of the uterus along with its blood vessels are shed off. This causes bleeding in women which is called menstruation. Menstruation occurs once in about 28 to 30 days. The first menstrual flow begins at puberty and is termed menarche. At 45 to 50 years of age, the menstrual cycle stops. Stoppage of menstruation is termed menopause. Initially, menstrual cycle may be irregular. It take some time to become regular. Menstrual cycle is controlled by hormones. The cycle includes the maturation of the egg, its release, thickening of uterine wall and its breakdown if pregnancy does not occur. In case the egg is fertilised it begins to divide and then gets embedded in the uterus for further development as you have learnt in Chapter 6 (Fig. 6.8). 7.6 How is the Sex of the Baby Determined? I heard my mother and my aunt talking about my cousin who is going to have a baby. They were discussing whether she would give birth to a boy or a girl. I wonder what makes the fertilised egg develop either into a boy or a girl! Paheli says that the reproductive life of a woman lasts from menarche to menopause. Is she right? Boy or Girl? Inside the fertilised egg or zygote is the instruction for determining the sex of the baby. This instruction is present in the thread-like structures, called chromosomes in the fertilised egg."}

Two chromosomes out of these are the sex chromosomes, named X and Y. A female has two X chromosomes, while a male has one X and one Y chromosome. The gametes (egg and sperm) have only one set of chromosomes. The unfertilised egg always has one X chromosome. But 2024-25 REACHING THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 85 sperms are of two kinds. One kind has an X chromosome, and the other kind has a Y chromosome. See Fig. 7.4. When a sperm containing X chromosome fertilises the egg, the zygote would have two X chromosomes and develop into a female child. If the sperm contributes a Y chromosome to the egg (ovum) at fertilisation, the zygote would develop into a male child. and ovaries to produce their hormones. You have already learnt that the pituitary gland is an endocrine gland. It is attached to the brain. Apart from the pituitary, the testes and the ovaries, there are other endocrine glands in the body such as thyroid, pancreas and adrenals (Fig. 7.5). Fig. 7.4 : Sex determination in humans boy girl sperms eggs Now you know that the sex chromosomes of the father determine the sex of an unborn baby.

Kaka\u2019s thyroid gland was not producing the hormone thyroxine. 2024-25 SCIENCE 86 Their aunt also told them that their uncle was suffering from \u2018diabetes\u2019 because his pancreas was not producing the hormone insulin in sufficient quantities. Boojho and Paheli then asked their aunt about the adrenal glands, which are also shown in the chart hung on the wall of her clinic. The aunt told them that adrenal glands secrete hormones which maintain the correct salt balance in the blood. Adrenals also produce the hormone adrenalin. It helps the body to adjust to stress when one is very angry, embarrassed or worried. Thyroid and adrenals secrete their hormones when they receive orders from the pituitary through its hormones. Pituitary also secretes growth hormone which is necessary for the normal growth of a person. controlled by insect hormones. In a frog, it is controlled by thyroxine, the hormone produced by thyroid. Thyroxine production requires the presence of iodine in water. If the water in which the tadpoles are growing does not contain sufficient iodine, the tadpoles cannot become adults. 7.8 Role of Hormones in Completing the Life History of Insects and Frogs You have already learnt about the life cycle of the frog. The tadpole passes through certain stages to become a frog (Chapter 6). This change from larva to adult is called metamorphosis (Fig. 6.10)."}

For infants, mother\u2019s milk provides all the nourishment that they need. Iron builds blood and iron-rich food such as leafy vegetables, jaggery, meat, citrus, Indian gooseberry (amla) are good for adolescents. Check items for lunch and dinner in your meal. Is the meal balanced and nutritious? Does it include cereals which give energy and milk, meat, nuts and pulses which provide proteins for growth? Also, does it include fats and sugar that give energy? What about fruits and vegetables which are protective foods?"}

Adolescent Pregnancy You might be knowing that in our country, the legal age for marriage is 18 years for girls and 21 years for boys. This is because teenage mothers are not prepared mentally or physically for motherhood. Early marriage and motherhood cause health problems in the mother and the child.

What do you do to make a moving ball move faster? How does a goalkeeper stop a ball? A hockey player changes the direction of the moving ball with a flick of the stick. How do fielders stop a ball hit by a batsman? (Fig. 8.1). In all these situations the ball is either made to move faster or slower or its direction of motion is changed.

Each of these actions usually results in some kind of change in the state of motion of an object. Can these terms be replaced with one or more terms? Let us find out.

Is attraction also a pull? What about repulsion between similar poles of two magnets? Is it a pull or a push? Do you notice that each of the actions can be grouped as a pull or a push or both? Can we infer from this, that to move an object, it has to be pushed or pulled? In science, a push or a pull on an object is called a force. Thus, we can say that the motion imparted to objects was due to the action of a force. When does a force come into play? Let us find out.

Similarly, the cow and the man in Fig. 8.3 (c) appear to pull each other. The girls in the two situations shown here are applying force on each other. Is it also true for the man and the cow? From these examples, we can infer that at least two objects must interact for a force to come into play. Thus, an interaction of one object with another object results in a force between the two objects. 2024-25 SCIENCE 96 Does it mean that the net force on an object is zero if the two forces acting on it in opposite directions are equal? rope in their direction. Sometimes the rope simply does not move. Is it not similar to the situation shown in Fig. 8.3 (b)? The team that pulls harder, that is, applies a larger force, finally wins the game. What do these examples suggest about the nature of force? Forces applied on an object in the same direction add to one another.

{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 95, "content": "If the two forces act in the opposite directions on an object, the net force acting on it is the difference between the two forces. What did you observe in Activity 8.2 when both of you were pushing the heavy box from opposite directions? Recall that in the tug-of-war when two teams pull equally hard, the rope does not move in any direction. So, we learn that a force could be larger or smaller than the other or equal to each other. The strength of a force is usually expressed by its magnitude. We have also to specify the direction in which a force acts. Also, if the direction or the magnitude of the applied force changes, its effect also changes. Activity 8.2 Choose a heavy object like a table or a box, which you can move only by pushing hard. Try to push it all by yourself. Can you move it? Now ask one of your friends to help you in pushing it in the same direction [Fig. 8.4(a)]. Is it easier to move it now? Can you explain why? Now push the same object, but ask your friend to push it from the opposite side [Fig. 8.4 (b)]. Does the object move? If it does, note the direction in which it moves. Can you guess which one of you is applying a larger force?

However, the effect on the object is due to the net force acting on it. 8.4 A Force can Change the State of Motion Let us now find out what happens when a force acts on an object. Activity 8.3 Take a rubber ball and place it on a level surface such as a table top or a concrete floor. Now, gently push the ball along the level surface (Fig. 8.6). Does the ball begin to move? Push the ball again while it is still moving. Is there any change in its speed? Does it increase or decrease? Next, place your palm in front of the moving ball. Remove your palm as soon as the moving ball touches it. Does your palm apply a force on the ball? What happens to the speed of the ball now? Does it increase or decrease? What would happen if you let your palm hold the moving ball? Fig. 8.6 : A ball at rest begins to move when a force is applied on it I have seen children competing with one another in moving a rubber tyre or a ring by pushing it (Fig. 8.7). I now understand why the speed of the tyre increases whenever it is pushed. Fig. 8.7 : To move a tyre faster it has to be pushed repeatedly You might recall similar situations. For example, while taking a penalty kick in football, the player applies a force on the ball. Before being hit, the ball was at rest and so its speed was zero. The applied force makes the ball move towards the goal."}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 97, "content": "Suppose, the goalkeeper dives or jumps up to save the goal. By his action the goalkeeper tries to apply a force on the moving ball. The force applied by him can stop or deflect the ball, saving a goal being scored. If the goalkeeper succeeds in stopping the ball, its speed decreases to zero. These observations suggest that a force applied on an object may change its speed. If the force applied on the object is in the direction of its motion, the speed of the object increases. If the force is applied in the direction opposite to the direction of motion, then it results in a decrease in the speed of the object. 2024-25 SCIENCE 98 Let us consider some more examples. In a game of volleyball, players often push the moving ball to their team mates to make a winning move. Sometimes the ball is returned to the other side of the court by pushing or smashing it. In cricket, a batsman plays his or her shot by applying a force on the ball with the bat. Is there any change in the direction of motion of the ball in these cases? In all these examples the speed and the direction of the moving ball change due to the application of a force. Can you give a few more examples of this kind? A change in either the speed of an object, or its direction of motion, or both, is described as a change in its state of motion. Thus, a force may bring a change in the state of motion of an object.

The state of rest is considered to be the state of zero speed. An object may be at rest or in motion; both are its states of motion. Paheli is curious to know whether application of a force can only change the speed of an object. Let us find out. Activity 8.4 Take a ball and place it on a level surface as you did in Activity 8.3. Make the ball move by giving it a push [Fig. 8.8(a)]. Now place a ruler in its path as shown in Fig. 8.8(b). In doing so, you would apply a force on the moving ball. Does the ball continue to move in the same direction after it strikes the ruler? Repeat the activity and try to obstruct the moving ball by placing the ruler in such a way that it makes different angles to its path. In each case note your observations about the direction of motion of the ball after it strikes the ruler. (b) Does it mean that the application of a force would always result in a change in the state of motion of the object? Let us find out. It is common experience that many a time application of force does not result in a change in the state of motion. For example, a heavy box may not move at all even if you apply the maximum force that you can exert."}

Column 2 of the Table suggests the manner in which a force can be applied on each object while Column 3 shows a diagram of the action.

What happens when you press a rubber ball placed on a table?"}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 100, "content": "In all these examples you saw that the application of force on an object may change its shape. Having performed all the above activities, you would have realised that a force l may make an object move from rest. l may change the speed of an object if it is moving. l may change the direction of motion of an object. l may bring about a change in the shape of an object. l may cause some or all of these effects. While a force may cause one or more of these effects, it is important to remember that none of these actions can take place without the action of a force. Thus, an object cannot move by itself, it cannot change speed by itself, it cannot change direction by itself and its shape cannot change by itself. 8.6 Contact Forces Muscular Force Can you push or lift a book lying on a table without touching it? Can you lift a bucket of water without holding it? Generally, to apply a force on an object, your body has to be in contact with the object. The contact may also be with the help of a stick or a piece of rope. When we push an object like a school bag or lift a bucket of water, where does the force come from? This force is caused by the action of muscles in our body. The force resulting due to the action of muscles is known as the muscular force. It is the muscular force that enables us to perform all activities involving movement or bending of our body. In Class VII you have learnt that in the process of digestion the food gets pushed through the alimentary canal. Could it be a muscular force that does it?"}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 101, "content": "You also know that lungs expand and contract while we inhale and exhale air during breathing. Where are these muscles located which make breathing possible? Can you list a few more examples of the force exerted by the muscles in our body? Animals also make use of muscular force to carry out their physical activities and other tasks. Animals like bullocks, horses, donkeys and camels are used to perform various tasks for us. In performing these tasks they use muscular force (Fig. 8.9). 2024-25 FORCE AND PRESSURE 101 Since muscular force can be applied only when it is in contact with an object, it is also called a contact force. Are there other types of contact forces? Let us find out. Friction Recall some of your experiences. A ball rolling along the ground gradually slows down and finally comes to rest. When we stop pedalling a bicycle, it gradually slows down and finally comes to a stop. A car or a scooter also comes to rest once its engine is switched off. Similarly, a boat comes to rest if we stop rowing it. Can you add some more such experiences? In all these situations no force appears to be acting on the objects, yet their speed gradually decreases and they come to rest after some time. What causes a change in their state of motion? Could some force be acting on them! Can you guess the direction in which the force must be acting in each case? The force responsible for changing the state of motion of objects in all these examples is the force of friction. It is the force of friction between the surface of the ball and the ground that brings the moving ball to rest."}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 102, "content": "Similarly, friction between water and the boat brings it to a stop once you stop rowing. The force of friction always acts on all the moving objects and its direction is always opposite to the direction of motion. Since the force of friction arises due to contact between surfaces, it is also an example of a contact force. You will learn more about this force in Chapter 9. You may be wondering whether it is essential for the agent applying a force on an object to be always in contact with it. Let us find out. 8.7 Non-contact Forces Magnetic Force Activity 8.6 Take a pair of bar magnets. Place the longer side of one of the magnets over three round shaped pencils or wooden rollers as shown in Fig. 8.10. Now bring one end of the other magnet near the end of the magnet placed on the rollers. Make sure that the two magnets do not touch each other. Observe what happens. Next, bring the other end of the magnet near the same end of the magnet placed on the rollers (Fig.8.10). Note what happens to the magnet placed on the rollers every time another magnet is brought near it. Fig. 8.10 : Observing attraction and repulsion between two magnets 2024-25 SCIENCE 102 Fig. 8.11 : A straw rubbed with paper attracts another straw but repels it if it has also been rubbed with a sheet of paper A straw is said to have acquired electrostatic charge after it has been rubbed with a sheet of paper. Such a straw is an example of a charged body. The force exerted by a charged body on another charged or uncharged body is known as electrostatic force. This force comes into play even when the bodies are not in contact."}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 103, "content": "The electrostatic force, therefore, is another example of a non-contact force. You will learn more about electric charges in Chapter 12. Gravitational Force You know that a coin or a pen falls to the ground when it slips off your hand. Leaves and fruits also fall to the ground when they get detached from the plant. Have you ever wondered why it is so? When the coin is held in your hand it is at rest. As soon as it is released, it begins to move downwards. It is clear that the state of motion of the coin undergoes a change. Can this happen without a force acting on it? Which is this force? Does the magnet on the rollers begin to move when the other magnet is brought near it? Does it always move in the direction of the approaching magnet? What do these observations suggest? Does it mean that some force must be acting between the two magnets? You have learnt in Class VI that like poles of two magnets repel each other and unlike poles attract each other. Attraction or repulsion between objects can also be seen as another form of pull or push. Do you have to bring the magnets in contact for observing the force between them? A magnet can exert a force on another magnet without being in contact with it. The force exerted by a magnet is an example of a non-contact force. Similarly, the force exerted by a magnet on a piece of iron is also a non-contact force. Electrostatic Force Activity 8.7 Take a plastic straw and cut it into nearly two equal pieces. Suspend one of the pieces from the edge of a table with the help of a piece of thread (Fig. 8.11)."}

What do you observe now? 2024-25 FORCE AND PRESSURE 103 Objects or things fall towards the earth because it pulls them. This force is called the force of gravity, or just gravity. This is an attractive force. The force of gravity acts on all objects. The force of gravity acts on all of us all the time without our being aware of it. Water begins to flow towards the ground as soon as we open a tap. Water in rivers flows downward due to the force of gravity. Try cutting vegetables with a blunt knife and then with a sharp knife. Which is easier? Do you get the feeling that the area over which the force is applied (for example, the pointed end of the nail) plays a role in making these tasks easier? The force acting on a unit area of a surface is called pressure. pressure = force / area on which it acts At this stage we consider only those forces which act perpendicular to the surface on which the pressure is to be computed. Gravity is not a property of the earth alone. In fact, every object in the universe, whether small or large, exerts a force on every other object. This force is known as the gravitational force."}

Did you succeed? Try now to push the nail by the pointed end (Fig. 8.12). Could you do it this time? I now understand why porters place a round piece of cloth on their heads, when they have to carry heavy loads (Fig. 8.13). By doing this they increase the area of contact of the load with their head. So, the pressure on their head is reduced and they find it easier to carry the load. Fig. 8.13 : A porter carrying a heavy load Fig. 8.12 : Pushing a nail into a wooden plank 2024-25 SCIENCE 104 Note that the area is in the denominator in the above expression. So, the smaller the area, larger the pressure on a surface for the same force. The area of the pointed end of the nail is much smaller than that of its head. The same force, therefore, produces a pressure sufficient to push the pointed end of the nail into the wooden plank. Can you explain now why shoulder bags are provided with broad straps and not thin strap? And, why the tools meant for cutting and piercing always have sharp edges? Do liquids and gases also exert pressure? Does it also depend on the area on which the force acts?

So, we find that gases, too, exert pressure on the walls of their container. 8.10 Atmospheric Pressure You know that there is air all around us. This envelop of air is known as the atmosphere. The atmospheric air extends up to many kilometres above the surface of the earth. The pressure exerted by this air is known as atmospheric pressure. We know that pressure is force per unit area. If we imagine a unit area and a very long cylinder standing on it filled with air, then the force of gravity on the air in this cylinder is the atmospheric pressure (Fig. 8.17). Fig. 8.18 : A rubber sucker pressed on a surface When you press the sucker, most of the air between its cup and the surface escapes out. The sucker sticks to the surface because the pressure of atmosphere acts on it. To pull the sucker off the surface, the applied force should be large enough to overcome the atmospheric pressure.

In fact, it would not be possible for any human being to pull the sucker off the But, how large or small is the atmospheric pressure? Let us get an idea about its magnitude.

Friction is caused by the irregularities on the two surfaces in contact. Even those surfaces which appear very smooth have a large number of minute irregularities on them (Fig. 9.5). Irregularities on the two surfaces lock into one another. When we attempt to move any surface, we have to apply a force to overcome interlocking. On rough surfaces, there are a larger number of irregularities. So the force of friction is greater if a rough surface is involved. Mark A Mark A Surface of book Surface of table 2024-25 FRICTION 115 We see that the friction is caused by the interlocking of irregularities in the two surfaces. It is obvious that the force of friction will increase if the two surfaces are pressed harder.

Is it easier to hold a kulhar (earthen pot) or a glass tumbler? Suppose the outer surface of the tumbler is greasy, or has a thin layer of cooking oil on it; would it become easier or more difficult to hold it? Just think : would it be possible to hold the glass at all if there is no friction? Recall also how difficult it is to move on a wet muddy track, or wet marble floor. Can you imagine being able to walk at all if there were no friction?"}

When your teacher is writing with chalk on the blackboard, its rough surface rubs off some chalk particles which stick to Recall your experience when last time you moved a heavy box from one place to another (Fig. 9.6). If you have no such experience, get that experience now. What is easier \u2014 to move the box from rest, or to move it when it is already in motion? The force required to overcome friction at the instant an object starts moving from rest is a measure of static friction. On the other hand, the force required to keep the object moving with the same speed is a measure of sliding friction. When the box starts sliding, the contact points on its surface, do not get enough time to lock into the contact points on the floor. So, the sliding friction is slightly smaller than the static Fig. 9.7 : A nail is fixed in the wall due to friction Fig. 9.6 : You have to push on the box to keep it moving 2024-25 SCIENCE 116 the black board. Could it happen if there were no friction between the chalk and the board? If an object started moving, it would never stop if there were no friction. Had there been no friction between the tyres of the automobiles and the road, they could not be started or stopped or turned to change the direction of motion. You could not fix a nail on the wall (Fig. 9.7) or tie a knot. Without friction no building could be constructed.

It wears out the materials whether they are screws, ball bearings or soles of shoes (Fig. 9.8). You must have seen worn-out steps of foot over-bridges at railway stations. Friction can also produce heat. Vigorously rub your palms together for a few minutes (Fig. 9.9). How do you feel? When you strike a matchstick against the rough surface, it catches fire (Fig. 9.10).

Have you ever thought why the sole of your shoe is grooved [Fig. 9.11 (a)]? It is done to provide the shoes better grip on the floor, so that you can move safely. Similarly, the treaded tyres of cars,trucks and bulldozers provide better grip with the ground. In some situations, however, friction is undesirable and we would want to minimise it. Why do you sprinkle fine powder on the carrom board (Fig. 9.12)? You might have noticed that when a few drops of oil are poured on the hinges of a door, the door moves smoothly. A bicycle and a motor mechanic uses grease between the moving parts of these machines. In all the above cases, we want to reduce Fig. 9.12 : Powder is sprinkled on the carrom board to reduce friction friction in order to increase efficiency."}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 119, "content": "When oil, grease or graphite is applied between the moving part of a machine, a thin layer is formed there and moving surfaces do not directly rub against each other (Fig. 9.13). Interlocking of irregularities is avoided to a great extent. Movement becomes smooth. The substances which reduce friction are called lubricants. In some machines, it may not be advisable to use oil as lubricant. An air cushion between the moving parts is used to reduce friction. We deliberately increase friction by using brake pads in the brake system of bicycles and automobiles. When you are riding a bicycle, the brake pads do not touch the wheels. But when you press the brake lever, these pads arrest the motion of the rim due to friction. The wheel stops moving. You might have seen that kabaddi players rub their hands with soil for a better grip of their opponents. Gymnasts apply some coarse substance on their hands to increase friction for better grip.

{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 120, "content": "Even a child can pull such pieces of luggage (Fig. 9.14). Why is it so? Let us find out. Can we reduce friction to zero by polishing surfaces or using large amount of lubricants? Friction can never be entirely eleminated. No surface is perfectly smooth. Some irregularities are always there. Fig. 9.15 : Motion of the book on rollers When one body rolls over the surface of another body, the resistance to its motion is called rolling friction. Rolling reduces friction. It is always easier to roll than to slide a body over another. That is the reason it is convenient to pull luggage fitted with rollers. Can you now understand why the wheel is said to be one of the greatest inventions of mankind? Since the rolling friction is smaller than the sliding friction, sliding is replaced in most machines by rolling by the use of ball bearings. Common examples are the use of ball bearings between hubs and the axles of ceiling fans and bicycles (Fig. 9.16). Fig. 9.14 : Rolling reduces friction 2024-25 FRICTION 119 9.6 Fluid Friction You know that air is very light and thin. Yet it exerts frictional force on objects moving through it. Similarly, water and other liquids exert force of friction when objects move through them. In science, the common name of gases and liquids is fluids. So we can say that fluids exert force of friction on objects in motion through them. The frictional force exerted by fluids is also called drag. The frictional force on an object in a fluid depends on its speed with respect to the fluid. The frictional force also depends on the shape of the object and the nature of the fluid."}

Birds and fishes have to move about in fluids all the time. Their bodies must have evolved to shapes which would make them lose less energy in overcoming friction.

The damaged eardrum can impair hearing. 10.5 Amplitude, Time Period and Frequency of a Vibration We have learnt that the to and fro motion of an object is known as vibration. This motion is also called oscillatory motion. Eardrum Inner ear 2024-25 SOUND 131 Hear the sound produced. Now bang the spoon on the tumbler and hear the sound produced again. Is the sound louder when the tumbler is struck hard? Now suspend a small thermocol ball touching the rim of the tumbler (Fig. 10.17). Vibrate the tumbler by striking it. See how far the ball is displaced. The displacement of the ball is a measure of the amplitude of vibration of the tumbler. Now, strike the tumbler gently and then a little harder. Compare the amplitudes of vibrations of the tumbler in the two cases."}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 132, "content": "In which case is the amplitude larger? Loudness of sound is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the vibration producing the sound. For example, if the amplitude becomes twice, the loudness increases by a factor of 4. The loudness is expressed in a unit called decibel (dB). The following table gives some idea of the loudness of sound coming from various sources. Normal breathing 10 dB Soft whisper (at 5m) 30 dB Normal conversation 60 dB Busy traffic 70 dB Average factory 80 dB Above 80 dB the noise becomes physically painful. I wonder why my voice is different from that of my teacher. Compare the sound of a baby with that of an adult. Is there any difference? Even if two sounds are equally loud, they differ in some way. Let us see how. Fig. 10.18 : Frequency determines the pitch of a sound The loudness of sound depends on its amplitude. When the amplitude of vibration is large, the sound produced is loud. When the amplitude is small, the sound produced is feeble. The frequency determines the shrillness or pitch of a sound. If the frequency of vibration is higher we say that the sound is shrill and has a higher pitch. If the frequency of vibration is lower, we say that the sound has a lower pitch. For example, a drum vibrates with a low frequency. Therefore, it produces 2024-25 SCIENCE 132 a low-pitched sound. On the other hand, a whistle has a high frequency and therefore, produces a sound of higher pitch (Fig. 10.18). A bird makes a high-pitched sound whereas a lion makes a low-pitched roar. However, the roar of a lion is very loud while the sound of the bird is quite feeble."}

Can you say that the frequency of the voice of a child is higher than that of an adult? Usually the voice of a woman has a higher frequency than that of a man. 10.6 Audible and Inaudible Sounds We know that we need a vibrating body for the production of sound. Can we hear the sound of all vibrating bodies? The fact is that sounds of frequencies less than about 20 vibrations per second (20 Hz) cannot be detected by the human ear. Such sounds are called inaudible. On the higher side, sounds of frequencies higher than about 20,000 vibrations per second (20 kHz) are also not audible to the human ear. Thus, for human ear, the range of audible frequencies is roughly from 20 to 20,000 Hz. Some animals can hear sounds of frequencies higher than 20,000 Hz. Dogs have this ability. The police use high frequency whistles which dogs can hear but humans cannot. The ultrasound equipment, familiar to us for investigating and tracking many medical problems, works at frequencies higher than 20,000 Hz. 10.7 Noise and Music We hear different types of sounds around us. Is the sound always pleasing? Does a sound sometimes cause discomfort to you? Some sounds are pleasant to the ear, whereas some are not. Suppose construction work is going on in your neighbourhood. Are the sounds coming from the construction site pleasing? Do you enjoy the sounds produced by horns of buses and trucks? Such unpleasant sounds are called noise. In a classroom, if all the students speak together, what would the sound produced be called? On the other hand you enjoy sounds from musical instruments."}

The string of a sitar also gives out a musical sound. But, if a musical sound becomes too loud, would it remain melodious? 10.8 Noise Pollution You already know about air pollution. Presence of unwanted gases and particles in air is called air pollution. Similarly, presence of excessive or unwanted sounds in the environment is called noise pollution. Can you list some sources of noise pollution? Major causes of noise pollution are sounds of vehicles, explosions including bursting of crackers, machines, loudspeakers etc. What sources in the home may lead to noise? Television and transistor radio at high volumes, some kitchen appliances, desert coolers, air conditioners, all contribute to noise pollution. 2024-25 SOUND 133 Hearing Impairment Total hearing impairment, which is rare, is usually from birth itself. Partial disability is generally the result of a disease, injury or age. Children with impaired hearing need special care. By learning sign language, such children can communicate effectively. Because speech develops as the direct result of hearing, a child with a hearing loss may have defective speech also. Technological devices for the hearing-impaired have made it possible for such persons to improve their quality of life. Society can do much to improve the living environment for the hearing-impaired and help them live normal lives. What are the Harms of Noise Pollution? Do you know that presence of excessive noise in the surroundings may cause many health related problems. Lack of sleep, hypertension (high blood- pressure), anxiety and many more health disorders may be caused by noise pollution. A person who is exposed to a loud sound continuously may get temporary or even permanent impairment of hearing."}

Golconda fort, near Hyderabad, is one of the most magnificient forts in India. It is famous for many engineering and architectural marvels. One of the marvels is the water supply system. But, perhaps, more astonishing is a dome near the entrance to the fort. A hand-clap at a particular point under the dome reverberates and can be heard at the highest point of the fort, about a kilometre away. This was devised as a warning system. If a guard saw a suspicious movement outside the fort, he clapped at the particular point under the dome, and the army inside the fort was alerted to the danger of the approaching enemy. 2024-25 CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ELECTRIC CURRENT CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ELECTRIC CURRENT Y our elders might have cautioned you against touching an electrical appliance with wet hands. But do you know why it is dangerous to touch an electrical appliance with wet hands? We have learnt earlier that the materials, which allow electric current to pass through them, are good conductors of electricity. On the other hand, materials, which do not allow electric current to pass through them easily, are poor conductors of electricity. In Class VI, we made a tester to test whether a particular material allows the electric current to pass through it or not."}

Now test if the tester is working or not. If it is still not working then replace the cells with fresh cells. Now that our tester is working, let us use it to test the various liquids.

Take care that the ends are not more than 1 cm apart but at the same time do not touch each other. Does the bulb Fig. 11.2 : Testing conduction of electricity in lemon juice or vinegar of the tester glow? Does lemon juice or vinegar conduct electricity? How would you classify lemon juice or vinegar\u2014 a good conductor or a poor conductor? When the liquid between the two ends of the tester allows the electric current to pass, the circuit of the tester becomes complete. The current flows in the circuit and the bulb glows. When the liquid does not allow the electric current to pass, the circuit of the tester is not complete and the bulb does not glow. In some situations even though the liquid is conducting, the bulb may not glow. It may have happened in Activity 11.2. What can be the reason?

We can use another effect of an electric current to make another kind of tester. Do you recall that electric current produces a magnetic effect?

She wonders if air is indeed a poor conductor under all conditions. This makes Boojho ask whether other materials classified as poor conductors also allow electricity to pass under certain conditions. From Table 11.1, we find that some liquids are good conductors of electricity and some are poor conductors. Actually, under certain conditions most materials can conduct. That is why it is preferable to classify materials as good conductors and poor conductors instead of classifying as conductors and insulators. We have tested the conduction of electricity through tap water. Let us now test the conduction of electricity through distilled water.

The water that we get from sources such as taps, hand pumps, wells and ponds is not pure. It may contain 2024-25 SCIENCE 142 several salts dissolved in it. Small amounts of mineral salts are naturally present in it. This water is thus a good conductor of electricity. On the other hand, distilled water is free of salts and is a poor conductor.

In 1800, a British chemist, William Nicholson (1753\u20131815), had shown that if electrodes were immersed in water, and a current was passed, bubbles of oxygen and hydrogen were produced. Oxygen bubbles formed on the electrode connected to the positive terminal of the battery and hydrogen bubbles formed on the other electrode. The passage of an electric current through a conducting solution causes chemical reactions. As a result, bubbles of a gas may be formed on the electrodes. Deposits of metal may be seen on electrodes. Changes of colour of solutions may occur. The reaction would depend on what solution and electrodes are used. These are some of the chemical effects of the electric current.

LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are available in many colours such as red, green, yellow, blue, white and are increasingly being used for many applications, for example in traffic signal lights. LEDs are increasingly being used for lighting. A cluster of white LEDs grouped together forms a LED light source. LED light sources consume less electricity and have longer lifetime than light bulbs and fluorescent tubes. Hence these are gradually becoming the preferred lighting source.

These are lightning and earthquakes. We shall also discuss what steps we can take to minimise destruction caused by these phenomena. 12.1Lightning You might have seen sparks on a electric pole when wires become loose. This phenomenon is quite common when wind is blowing and shaking the wires. You might also have seen sparks when a plug is loose in its socket. Lightning is also an electric spark, but on a huge scale. In ancient times, people did not understand the cause of these sparks. They were, therefore, afraid of lightning and thought that the wrath of gods was visiting them. Now, of course, we understand that lightning is caused by the accumulation of charges in the clouds."}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 152, "content": "We need not be afraid of lightning, but we have to take precautions to protect ourselves from the deadly sparks. The Sparks that the Greeks Knew About The ancient Greeks knew as early as 600 B.C. that when amber (amber is a kind of resin) was rubbed with fur, it attracted light objects such as hair. You might have seen that when you take off woollen or polyester clothes, your hair stands on end. If you take off these clothes in the dark, you even see a spark and hear a crackling sound. In 1752 Benjamin Franklin, an American scientist, showed that lightning and the spark from your clothes are essentially the same phenomena. However, it took 2000 years for this realisation to occur. We shall now study some properties of electric charges. We shall also see how they are related to the lightning in the sky. Let us perform some activities to understand the nature of electric charges. But recall first what you might have played as a game. When you rub I wonder why they took so many years to realise the similarity. Scientific discoveries are a result of hardwork by many people. It can sometimes take a long time. 2024-25 SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA 151 a plastic scale on your dry hair, the scale can attract very small pieces of paper. 12.2 Charging by Rubbing Activity 12.1 Take a used ballpen refill and rub it vigorously with a piece of polythene. Bring it close to small pieces of paper. Take care not to touch the rubbed end of the refill with your hand or with a metallic object. Repeat the activity with small pieces of dry leaf, husk and mustard seeds. Record your observations. When a plastic refill is rubbed with polythene, it acquires a small electric charge."}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 153, "content": "Similarly, when a plastic comb is rubbed with dry hair, it acquires a small charge. These objects are called charged objects. In the process of charging the refill and the plastic comb, polythene and hair also get charged. Let\u2019s try to charge some other objects that are familiar to you.

What happens if two charged objects made of different materials are brought close to each other? Let\u2019s find out. (b) Rub a refill and place it gently in a glass tumbler as before (Fig. 12.3).

Does it indicate that the charge on the balloon is of a different kind from the charge on the refill? Can we say then, that there are two kinds of 2024-25 SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA 153 charges? Can we also say that the charges of the same kind repel each other, while charges of different kind attract each other? It is a convention to call the charge acquired by a glass rod when it is rubbed with silk as positive. The other kind of charge is said to be negative. It is observed that when a charged glass rod is brought near a charged plastic straw rubbed with polythene there is attraction between the two. What do you think would be the kind of charge on the plastic straw? Your guess, that the plastic straw would carry a negative charge is correct. The electrical charges generated by rubbing are static. They do not move by themselves. When charges move, they constitute an electric current. You have been reading about electric current since Class VI. The current in a circuit which makes a bulb glow, or the current that makes a wire hot, is nothing but a motion of charges. 12.4 Transfer of Charge Activity 12.4 Take an empty jam bottle. Take a piece of cardboard slightly bigger in size than the mouth of the bottle."}

Charge a refill and touch Fig 12.4 : A simple electroscope it with the end of the paper clip. Observe what happens. Is there any effect on the foil strips? Do they repel each other or attract each other? Now, touch other charged bodies with the end of the paper clip. Do foil strips behave in the same way in all cases? Can this apparatus be used to detect whether a body is charged or not? Can you explain why the foil strips repel each other? The aluminium foil strips receive the same charge from the charged refill through the paper clip (remember that metals are good conductors of electricity). The strips carrying similar charges repel each other and they become wide open. Such a device can be used to test whether an object is carrying charge or not. This device is known as electroscope. Thus, we find that electrical charge can be transferred from a charged object to another through a metal conductor. Touch the end of the paper clip gently with hand and you will find a change in 2024-25 SCIENCE 154 the foil strips. They come back to their original state.

{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 156, "content": "The reason is that the foil strips lose charge to the earth through your body. We say that the foil strips are discharged. The process of transferring of charge from a charged object to the earth is called earthing. Earthing is provided in buildings to protect us from electrical shocks due to any leakage of electrical current. 12.5 The Story of Lightning It is now possible to explain lightning in terms of the charges produced by rubbing. During the development of a thunderstorm, the air currents move upward while the water droplets move downward. These vigorous movements cause separation of charges. By a process, not yet completely understood, the positive charges collect near the upper edges of the clouds and the negative charges accumulate near the lower edges. There is accumulation of positive charges near the ground also. When the magnitude of the accumulated charges becomes very large, the air which is normally a poor conductor of electricity, is no longer able to resist their flow. Negative and positive charges meet, producing streaks of bright light and sound. We see streaks as lightning (Fig. 12.5). The process is called an electric discharge. Fig. 12.5 : Accumulation of charges leading to lightning. 2024-25 SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA 155 The process of electric discharge can occur between two or more clouds, or between clouds and the earth. Today we need not get frightened by lightning like our ancestors did. Now we understand the basic phenomenon. Scientists are trying hard to improve this understanding. However, lightning strike could destroy life and property. It is, therefore, necessary to take measures to protect ourselves. 12.6 Lightning Safety During lightning and thunderstorm no open place is safe. l Hearing thunder is an alert to rush to a safer place."}

Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts during a Thunderstorm Outside Open vehicles, like motorbikes, tractors, construction machinery, open cars are not safe. Open fields, tall trees, shelters in parks, elevated places do not protect us from lightning strokes. Carrying an umbrella is not at all a good idea during thunderstorms. If in a forest, take shelter under shorter trees. If no shelter is available and you are in an open field, stay far away from all trees. Stay away from poles or other metal objects. Do not lie on the ground. Instead, squat low on the ground. Place your hands on your knees with your head between the hands (Fig. 12.6). This position will make you the smallest target to be struck. Inside the house Lightning can strike telephone cords, electrical wires and metal pipes (Do you remember, lightning is an electrical discharge?). During a thunderstorm contact with these should be avoided. It is safer to use mobile phones and cordless phones. However, it is not wise to call up a person who is receiving your phone through a wired phone. Bathing should be avoided during thunderstorms to avoid contact with running water. Electrical appliances like computers, TVs, etc., should be unplugged. Electrical lights can remain on. They do not cause any harm.

One end of the rod is kept out in the air and the other is buried deep in the ground (Fig. 12.7). The rod provides easy route for the transfer of electric charge to the ground. The metal columns used during construction, electrical wires and water pipes in the buildings also protect us to an extent. But do not touch them during a thunderstorm. 12.7 Earthquakes You just learnt about thunderstorm and lightning. These natural phenomena can cause large scale destruction of human life and property. Fortunately, these phenomena can be predicted to some extent. The weather department can warn about a thunderstorm developing in some area. If a thunderstorm occurs there is always a possibility of lightning and cyclones accompanying it. So, we get time to take measures to protect ourselves from the damage caused by these phenomena. Fig. 12.7 : Lightning conductor lightning conductor copper plate 2024-25 SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA 157 There is, however, one natural phenomenon which we are not yet able to predict accurately. It is an earthquake. It can cause damage to human life and property on a huge scale. A major earthquake occurred in India on 8 October 2005 in Uri and Tangdhar towns of North Kashmir (Fig. 12.8). Before that a major earthquake occurred on 26 January 2001 in Bhuj district of Gujarat. Activity 12.5 Ask your parents about the huge damage to life and property caused by these earthquakes.

How could it be true? crust. Earthquakes occur all the time, all over the earth. They are not even noticed. Major earthquakes are much less frequent. They can cause immense damage to buildings, bridges, dams and people. There can be a great loss to life and property. Earthquakes can cause floods, landslides and tsunamis. A major tsunami occurred in the Indian Ocean on 26 December 2004. All the coastal areas around the ocean suffered huge losses. Activity 12.6 Take an outline map of the world. Locate the eastern coast and Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India. Mark other countries around the Indian Ocean which could have suffered damage. Collect accounts of the devastation caused by the tsunami in India from your parents, or other elders in the family or in the neighbourhood. What Causes an Earthquake? Fig. 12.10 : Earth plates What could cause a disturbance inside the earth? Fig. 12.9 : Structure of the earth Now we know that the tremors are caused by the disturbance deep down inside the uppermost layer of the earth called the crust (Fig. 12.9). In ancient times, people did not know the true cause of earthquakes. Their ideas were, therefore, expressed in mythical stories such as the one told by Boojho\u2019s grandmother."}

Since earthquakes are caused by the movement of plates, the boundaries of the plates are the weak zones where earthquakes are more likely to occur. The weak zones are also known as seismic or fault zones. In India, the areas most threatened are Kashmir, Western and Central Himalayas, the whole of North-East, Rann of Kutch, Rajasthan and the Indo\u2013Gangetic Plane. Some areas of South India also fall in the danger zone (Fig. 12.12). If scientists know so much about earthquakes, can they also predict when and where the next one will strike? I read somewhere that underground explosions could also cause tremors. Fig. 12.11 : Movements of earth\u2019s plates Fig. 12.12 : Movements of Indian earth\u2019s plate The power of an earthquake is expressed in terms of a magnitude on a scale called the Richter scale.

The instrument is simply a vibrating rod, or a pendulum, which starts vibrating when tremors occur. A pen is attached to the vibrating system. The pen records the seismic waves on a paper which moves under it. By studying these waves, scientists can construct a complete map of the earthquake, as shown in Fig. 12.14. They can also estimate its power to cause destruction.

This means that an earthquake of magnitude 6 does not have one and half times the destructive energy of an earthquake of magnitude 4. In fact, an increase of 2 in magnitude means 1000 times more destructive energy. Therefore, an earthquake of magnitude 6 has thousand times more destructive energy than an earthquake of magnitude 4. Protection against Earthquakes We know from the earlier pages that earthquakes cannot be predicted. We have also seen that they can be highly destructive. It is, therefore, important that we take necessary precautions to protect ourselves all the time. People living in seismic zones, where the earthquakes are more likely to occur, have to be specially prepared. First of all, the buildings in these zones should be so designed that they can withstand major tremors. Modern building technology can make it possible."}

It means that eyes alone cannot see any object. It is only when light from an object enters our eyes that we see the object. The light may have been emitted by the object, or may have been reflected by it. You learnt in Class VII that a polished or a shiny surface can act as a mirror. A mirror changes the direction of light that falls on it. Can you tell in which direction the light falling on a surface will be reflected? Let us find out. 13.2 Laws of Reflection Activity 13.1 Fix a white sheet of paper on a drawing board or a table. Take a comb and close all its openings except one in the middle. You can use a strip of black paper for this purpose. Hold the comb perpendicular to the sheet of paper. Throw light from a torch through the opening of the comb from one side (Fig. 13.1). With slight adjustment of the torch and the comb you will see a ray of light along the paper on the other side of the comb. Keep the comb and the torch steady. Place a strip of plane mirror in the path of the light ray (Fig. 13.1). What do you observe? After striking the mirror, the ray of light is reflected in another direction.

For simplicity, we use the term ray for a narrow beam of light. Draw lines showing the position of the plane mirror, the incident ray and the reflected ray on the paper with the help of your friends. Remove the mirror and the comb. Draw a line making an angle of 90\u00ba to the line representing the mirror at the point where the incident ray strikes the mirror. This line is known as the normal to the reflecting surface at that point (Fig. 13.2). The angle Table 13.1 : Angles of Incidence and Reflection S.

Since the reflected rays do not actually meet at I, but only appear to do so, we say that a virtual image of the point O is formed at I. As you have learnt already in Class VII, such an image cannot be obtained on a screen. You may recall that in an image formed by a mirror the left of the object appears on the right and the right appears on the left. This is known as lateral inversion."}

Remember that the laws of reflection are valid at each point of the surface. Use these laws to construct reflected rays at various points. Are they parallel to one another? You will find that these rays are reflected in different directions. (Fig. 13.7) When all the parallel rays reflected from a rough or irregular surface are not parallel, the reflection is known as diffused or irregular reflection. Remember that the diffused reflection is not due to the failure of the laws of reflection. It is caused by the irregularities in the reflecting surface, like that of a cardboard. On the other hand, reflection from a smooth surface like that of a mirror is called regular reflection (Fig. 13.8). Images are formed by regular reflection.

Do you know how you could see the hair at the back of your head? Paheli recalls having constructed a periscope as an Extended Activity in Class VI. The periscope makes use of two plane mirrors.

What happens if two plane mirrors are used in combination? Let us see. Do We See all Objects due to Reflected Light? Nearly everything you see around is seen due to reflected light. Moon, for example, receives light from the Sun and reflects it. That\u2019s how we see the moon. The objects which shine in the light of other objects are called illuminated objects. Can you name some other such objects? There are other objects, which give their own light, such as the Sun, fire, flame of a candle and an electric lamp. Their light falls on our eyes. That is how we see them. The objects which emit their own light are known as luminous objects. Fig. 13.9 : Mirror at the hair dresser shop I have a question. Can the reflected rays be further reflected if incident on another mirror? 2024-25 SCIENCE 170 Activity 13.5 Take two plane mirrors. Set them at right angles to each other with their edges touching (Fig. 13.10). To hinge them you can use adhesive tape. Place a coin in between the mirrors. How many images of the coin do you see (Fig. 13.10)? Now hinge the mirrors using the adhesive tape at different angles, say 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0 etc. Place some object (say a candle) in between them.

This idea of number of images formed by mirrors placed at an angle to one another is used in a kaleidoscope to make numerous beautiful patterns. You can also make a kaleidoscope yourself. Kaleidoscope Activity 13.6 To make a kaleidoscope, get three rectangular mirror strips each about 15 cm long and 4 cm wide. Join them together to form a prism as shown in Fig. 13.12(a). Fix this arrangement of mirrors in a circular cardboard tube or tube of a thick chart paper. Make sure that the tube is slightly longer than the mirror strips. Close one end of the tube by a cardboard disc having a hole in the centre, through which you can see [Fig. 13.12(b)]. To make the disc durable, paste a piece of transparent plastic sheet under the cardboard Fig. 13.12 : Making a kaleidoscope 2024-25 LIGHT 171 disc. At the other end, touching the mirrors, fix a circular plane glass plate [Fig. 13.12(c)]. Place on this glass plate several small pieces of coloured glass (broken pieces of coloured bangles). Close this end of the tube by a ground glass plate. Allow enough space for the colour pieces to move around. Your kaleidoscope is ready. When you peep through the hole, you will be able to see a variety of patterns in the tube. An interesting feature of a kaleidoscope is that you will never see the same pattern again. Designers of wallpapers and fabrics and artists often use kaleidoscopes to get ideas for new patterns."}

You also learnt that it consists of seven colours. Here is another activity (Activity 13.7) showing that sunlight consists of several colours. 13.7 What is inside Our Eyes? We see things only when light coming from them enters our eyes. Eye is one of our most important sense organs. It is, therefore, important to understand its structure and working. The eye has a roughly spherical shape. The outer coat of the eye is white. It is tough so that it can protect the interior of the eye from accidents. Its transparent front part is called Activity 13.7 Fig. 13.13 : Dispersion of light Get a plane mirror of a suitable size. Place it in a bowl (katori) as shown in Fig. 13.13. Fill the bowl with water. Put this arrangement near a window in such a way that direct sunlight falls on the mirror. Adjust the position of the bowl so that the reflected light from the mirror falls on a wall. If the wall is not white, fix a sheet of white paper on it. Reflected light will be seen to have many colours. How can you explain this? The mirror and water form a prism. As you learnt in Class VII, this breaks up the light into its colours, Splitting of light into its colours is known as dispersion of light. Rainbow is a natural phenomenon showing dispersion. 2024-25 SCIENCE 172 Fig. 13.15 : Demonstration of blind spot Caution : For this activity, never use a laser torch.

Do you notice any change in the size of the pupil? In which case was the pupil larger? Why do you think it was so? In which case do you need to allow more light in the eye, when the light is dim or bright? Behind the pupil of the eye is a lens which is thicker in the centre. What kind of lens is thicker at the centre? Recall what you learnt about lenses in cornea (Fig. 13.14). Behind the cornea, we find a dark muscular structure called iris. In the iris, there is a small opening called the pupil. The size of the pupil is controlled by the iris. The iris is that part of eye which gives it its distinctive colour. When we say that a person has green eyes, we refer actually to the colour of the iris. The iris controls the amount of light entering into the eye. Let us see how. Iris Lens Ciliary muscle Cornea Retina Optic Nerve Fig. 13.14 : Human eye Class VII. The lens focuses light on the back of the eye, on a layer called retina (Fig. 13.14). The retina contains several nerve cells. Sensations felt by the nerve cells are then transmitted to the brain through the optic nerve. There are two kinds of cells\u2013 (i) cones, which are sensitive to bright light and (ii) rods, which are sensitive to dim light. Cones sense colour. At the junction of the optic nerve and the retina, there are no sensory cells, so no vision is possible at that spot. This is called the blind spot."}

The distance between two marks may be 6-8 cm. Hold the sheet of paper at an arm\u2019s length from the eye. Close your left eye. Look continuously at the cross. Move the sheet slowly towards you, keeping your eye on the cross. What do you find? Does the round mark disappear at some point? Now close your right eye. Look at the round mark now and repeat the activity. Does the cross disappear? The disappearance of the cross or the round mark shows that there is a point on the retina which cannot send messages to the brain when light falls on it. 2024-25 LIGHT 173 Nature has provided eyes with eyelids to prevent any object from entering the eye. Eyelids also shut out light when not required. Eye is such a wonderful instrument that it (normal) can clearly see distant objects as well as objects nearby. The minimum distance at which the eye can see objects distinctly varies with age. The most comfortable distance at which one can read with a normal eye is about 25 cm. Some persons can see objects close to them clearly but cannot see distant objects so clearly. On the other hand, some persons cannot see objects nearby clearly but they can see distant objects quite well. With suitable corrective lenses, these defects of the eye can be corrected. Sometimes, particularly in old age, eyesight becomes foggy. It is due to the eye lens becoming cloudy. When it happens, persons are said to have cataract. There is a loss of vision, sometimes extremely severe. It is possible to treat this defect."}

Have a regular checkup\u2014 l If advised, use suitable spectacles. l Too little or too much light is bad for eyes. Insufficient light causes eyestrain and headaches. Too much light, like that of the Sun, a powerful The movies that we see are actually a number of separate pictures in proper sequence. They are made to move across the eye usually at the rate of 24 pictures per second (faster than 16 per second). So, we see a moving picture. Front side of cardboard Reverse side of cardboard The impression of an image does not vanish immediately from the retina. It persists there for about 1/16th of a second. So, if still images of a moving object are flashed on the eye at a rate faster than 16 per second, then the eye perceives this object as moving.

Do not read by bringing the book too close to your eyes or keeping it too far. You learnt about balanced diet in Class VI. If food is deficient in some components, eyes may also suffer. Lack of vitamin A in foodstuff is responsible for many eye troubles. Most common amongst them is night blindness. One should, therefore, include in the diet components which have vitamin A. Raw carrots, broccoli and green Did you know? Animals have eyes shaped in different ways. Eyes of a crab are quite small but they enable the crab to look all around. So, the crab can sense even if the enemy approaches from behind. Butterflies have large eyes that seem to be made up of thousands of little eyes (Fig. 13.17). They can see not only in the front and the sides but the back as well. A night bird (owl) can see very well in the night but not during the day. On the other hand, day light birds (kite, eagle) can see well during the day but not in the night. The owl has a large cornea and a large pupil to allow more light in its eye. Also, it has on its retina a large number of rods and only a few cones. The day birds on the other hand, have more cones and fewer rods. Fig. 13.17 : Eyes of a butterfly Eyes vegetables (such as spinach) and cod liver oil are rich in vitamin A. Eggs, milk, curd, cheese, butter and fruits such as papaya and mango are also rich in vitamin A. 13.9 Visually Impaired Persons Can Read and Write Some persons, including children, can be visually impaired."}

The most popular resource for visually challenged persons is Braille. Louis Braille Louis Braille, himself a visually challenged person, developed a system for visually challenged persons and published it in 1821. Non-optical and optical aids for visually impaired Non-optical aids include visual aids, tactual aids (using the sense of touch), auditory aids (using the sense of hearing) and electronic aids. Visual aids, can magnify words, can provide suitable intensity of light and material at proper distances. Tactual aids, including Braille writer slate and stylus, help the visually challenged persons in taking notes, reading and writing. Auditory aids include cassettes, tape recorders, talking books and other such devices. Electronic aids, such as talking calculators and computers, are also available for performing many computational tasks. Closed circuit television, also an electronic aid, enlarges printed material with suitable contrast and illumination. Nowadays, use of audio CDs and voice boxes with computers are also very helpful for listening to and writing the desired text. Optical aids include bifocal lenses, contact lenses, tinted lenses, magnifiers and telescopic aids. While the lens combinations are used to rectify visual limitations, telescopic aids are available to view chalkboard and class demonstrations. The present system was adopted in 1932. There is Braille code for common languages, mathematics and scientific notation. Many Indian languages can be read using the Braille system. Braille system has 63 dot patterns or characters."}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 179, "content": "Each character represents a letter, a combination of letters, a common word or a grammatical sign. Dots are arranged in cells of two vertical rows of three dots each. Patterns of dots to represent some English letters and some common words are shown below.

Fig. 13.18 : Example of dot patterns used in Braille System 2024-25 SCIENCE 176 Some visually impaired Indians have great achievements to their credit. Diwakar, a child prodigy has given amazing performances as a singer. Ravindra Jain, born completely visually impaired, obtained his Sangeet Prabhakar degree from Allahabad. He had shown his excellence as a lyricist, singer and music composer. Lal Advani, himself visually impaired, established an Association for special education and rehabilitation of disabled in India. Besides this, he represented India on Braille problems in UNESCO. Helen A. Keller, an American author and lecturer, is perhaps the most well- known and inspiring visually challenged person. She lost her sight when she was only 18 months old. But because of her resolve and courage she could complete her graduation from a university. She wrote a number of books including The Story of my Life (1903). Helen A. Keller Visually impaired people learn the Braille system by beginning with letters, then special characters and letter combinations. Methods depend upon recognition by touching. Each character has to be memorised. Braille texts can be produced by hand or by machine. Typewriter-like devices and printing machines have now been developed."}
