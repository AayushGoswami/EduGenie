# This code initializes a simple Streamlit app that allows users to ask questions
# based on their documents, retrieves relevant chunks using a retriever,
# and generates answers using a language model. The UI is designed to be user-friendly
# and informative, providing clear feedback during the retrieval and generation processes.
# The footer includes a note about the technologies used to build the app.
# This code is a complete Streamlit app that allows users to ask questions
