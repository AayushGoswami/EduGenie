Later, they\ncould cultivate land and produce rice,\nwheat and other food crops. Thus,\nwas born \u2018Agriculture\u2019. When plants of the same kind are\ncultivated at one place on a large scale,\nit is called a crop. For example, crop of\nwheat means that all the plants grown\nin a field are that of wheat. You already know that crops are of\ndifferent types like cereals, vegetables\nand fruits. These can be classified on the\nbasis of the season in which they grow. India is a vast country. The climatic\nconditions like temperature, humidity\nand rainfall vary from one region to\nanother. Accordingly, there is a rich\nYou have learnt that all living\norganisms require food.

But, first of all why do we have to eat\nfood? You already know that energy from\nthe food is utilised by organisms for\ncarrying out their various body\nfunctions, such as digestion, respiration\nand excretion. We get our food from\nplants, or animals, or both."}

The rainy season in India\nis generally from June to September. Paddy, maize, soyabean, groundnut and\ncotton are kharif crops. (ii) Rabi Crops : The crops grown in the\nwinter season (October to March) are\ncalled rabi crops. Examples of rabi\ncrops are wheat, gram, pea, mustard\nand linseed.

One of the most\nimportant tasks in agriculture is to turn\nthe soil and loosen it. This allows the\nroots to penetrate deep into the soil. The\nloose soil allows the roots to breathe\neasily even when they go deep into the\nsoil. Why does the loosening of soil allow\nthe roots to breathe easily? The loosened soil helps in the growth\nof earthworms and microbes present in\nthe soil. These organisms are friends of\nthe farmer since they further turn and\nloosen the soil and add humus to it.

Soil supplies mineral nutrients to the\ncrop plants. These nutrients are\nessential for the growth of plants. In\ncertain areas, farmers grow crop after\ncrop in the same field. The field is never\nleft uncultivated or fallow. Imagine what\nhappens to the nutrients? Continuous cultivation of crops\nmakes the soil poor in nutrients. Therefore, farmers have to add manure\nto the fields to replenish the soil with\nnutrients. This process is called\nmanuring. Improper or insufficient\nmanuring results in weak plants. Manure is an organic substance\nobtained from the decomposition of\nplant or animal wastes. Farmers dump\nplant and animal waste in pits at open\nplaces and allow it to decompose. The\ndecomposition is caused by some\nmicroorganisms. The decomposed\nmatter is used as organic manure.

How are\nthey different from manure? Fertilisers\nare produced in factories. Some\nexamples of fertilisers are\u2014 urea,\nammonium \nsulphate, \nsuper\nphosphate, potash, NPK (Nitrogen,\nPhosphorus, Potassium). The use of fertilisers has helped\nfarmers to get better yield of crops\nsuch as wheat, paddy and maize. But\nexcessive use of fertilisers has made\nthe soil less fertile. Fertilisers have  also\nbecome a source of water pollution. Therefore, in order to maintain the\nfertility of the soil, we have to\nsubstitute fertilisers with organic\nmanure or leave the field uncultivated\n(fallow) in between two crops. The use of manure improves soil\ntexture as well as its water retaining\ncapacity. It replenishes the soil with\nnutrients. Another method of replenishing\nthe soil with nutrients is through crop\nrotation. This can be done by growing\ndifferent crops alternately. Earlier,\nfarmers in northern India used to\ngrow legumes as fodder in one season\nand wheat in the next season. This\nhelped in the replenishment of the soil\nwith nitrogen. Farmers are being\nencouraged to adopt this practice. In the previous classes, you have\nlearnt about Rhizobium  bacteria. These are present in the nodules of\nroots of leguminous plants.

Water is important for proper growth\nand development. Water is absorbed by\nthe plant roots. Along with water,\nminerals and fertilisers are also\nabsorbed. Plants contain nearly 90%\nwater. Water is essential because\ngermination of seeds does not take place\nunder dry conditions. Nutrients\ndissolved in water are transported to\neach part of the plant. Water also\nprotects the crop from both frost and\nhot air currents. To maintain the\nmoisture of the soil for healthy crop\ngrowth, fields have to be watered\nregularly. The supply of water to crops at\nregular intervals is called irrigation. The\ntime and frequency of irrigation varies\nfrom crop to crop, soil to soil and season\nto season. In summer, the frequency of\nwatering is higher. Why is it so? Could\nit be due to the increased rate of\nevaporation of water from the soil and\nthe leaves?

Have these other\nplants been planted\npurposely? In a field many other undesirable\nplants may grow naturally along with\nthe crop. These undesirable plants are\ncalled weeds. The removal of weeds is called\nweeding. Weeding is necessary since\nweeds compete with the crop plants for\nwater, nutrients, space and light. Thus,\nthey affect the growth of the crop. Some\nweeds interfere even in harvesting and\nmay be poisonous for animals and\nhuman beings. Farmers adopt many ways to remove\nweeds and control their growth. Tilling\nbefore sowing of crops helps in\nuprooting and killing of weeds, which\nmay then dry up and get mixed with\nthe soil. The best time for the removal\nof weeds is before they produce flowers\nand seeds. The manual removal includes\nphysical removal of weeds by uprooting\nor cutting them close to the ground,\nfrom time to time. This is done with the\nhelp of a khurpi. A seed drill [Fig. 1.2(b)]\nis also used to uproot weeds. Weeds are also controlled by using\ncertain chemicals, called weedicides,\nlike 2,4-D. These are sprayed in the\nfields to kill the weeds. They do not\ndamage the crops."}

New\ninformation about agriculture is obtained through radio, T.V. and\nother sources. As a result we are able to get good crops on a large\nscale. This year we got 9 to 11 quintals of gram crop/acre and 20\nto 25 quintals of wheat/acre. In my opinion awareness of new\ntechnology is important for better crop yield.

If a fire\nbreaks out in your house or in your\nneighbourhood, the first thing to do\nis to call the fire service. Does your city/town have a fire\nbrigade station? When a fire brigade arrives, what\ndoes it do? It pours water on the fire\n(Fig. 4.6). Water cools the combustible\nmaterial so that its temperature is\nbrought \nbelow \nits \nignition\ntemperature.

These are: fuel, air (to supply\noxygen) and heat (to raise the\ntemperature of the fuel beyond the\nignition temperature). Fire can be\ncontrolled by removing one or more of\nthese requirements. The job of a fire\nextinguisher is to cut off the supply of\nair, or to bring down the temperature\nof the fuel, or both.

If electrical\nequipment is on fire, water\nmay conduct electricity\nand harm those trying to\ndouse the fire. Water is\nalso not suitable for fires\ninvolving oil and petrol. Do\nyou recall that water is\nheavier than oil? So, it\nsinks below the oil, and oil\nkeeps burning on the top. For fires involving electrical equipment and inflammable materials like\npetrol, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best extinguisher. CO2, being heavier than\noxygen, covers the fire like a blanket. Since the contact between the fuel and\noxygen is cut off, the fire is controlled. The added advantage of CO2 is that in\nmost cases it does not harm the electrical equipment. How do we get the supply of carbon dioxide? It can be stored at high pressure\nas a liquid in cylinders. In what form is the LPG stored in cylinders? When\nreleased from the cylinder, CO2 expands enormously in volume and cools down. So, it not only forms a blanket around the fire, it also brings down the\ntemperature of the fuel. That is why it is an excellent fire extinguisher. Another\nway to get CO2 is to release a lot of dry powder of chemicals like sodium\nbicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate. Near the fire, these\nchemicals give off CO2. CAUTION : Do not handle the gas\nstove yourself. Ask your parents\nto help. Fig. 4.7 : Fire extinguisher\nin most cases cannot be eliminated.

You will\nremember that plants that reproduce\nsexually have male and female\nreproductive parts. Can you name these\nparts?

When sperms come in\ncontact with an egg, one of the sperms\nmay fuse with the egg. Such fusion of\nthe egg and the sperm is called\nfertilisation (Fig. 6.5). During\nfertilisation, the nuclei of the sperm and\nthe egg fuse to form a single nucleus. This results in the formation of a\nfertilised egg or zygote (Fig. 6.6).

In such cases, doctors\ncollect freshly released egg and\nsperms and keep them together for a\nfew hours for IVF or in vitro\nfertilisation (fertilisation outside the\nbody). In case fertilisation occurs,\nthe zygote is allowed to develop for\nabout a week and then it is placed in\nthe mother\u2019s uterus.

This causes\nchanges in boys about which you have\njust learnt, for example, the growth of\nfacial hair. Once puberty is reached in\ngirls, ovaries begin to produce the female\nhormone or estrogen which makes the\nbreasts develop. Milk secreting glands\nor mammary glands develop inside the\nbreasts.

During this\nperiod, the wall of the uterus becomes\nthick so as to receive the egg, in case\nit is fertilised and begins to develop. This results in pregnancy. If\nfertilisation does not occur, the\nreleased egg, and the thickened lining\nof the uterus along with its blood\nvessels are shed off. This causes\nbleeding in women which is called\nmenstruation. Menstruation occurs\nonce in about 28 to 30 days. The first\nmenstrual flow begins at puberty  and\nis termed menarche. At 45 to 50 years\nof age, the menstrual cycle stops. Stoppage of menstruation is termed\nmenopause. Initially, menstrual cycle\nmay be irregular. It take some time to\nbecome regular. Menstrual cycle is controlled by\nhormones.

In\nperforming these tasks they use\nmuscular force (Fig. 8.9). 2024-25\nFORCE AND PRESSURE\n101\nSince muscular force can be applied\nonly when it is in contact with an object,\nit is also called a contact force. Are there\nother types of contact forces? Let us find\nout. Friction\nRecall some of your experiences. A ball\nrolling along the ground gradually slows\ndown and finally comes to rest. When\nwe stop pedalling a bicycle, it gradually\nslows down and finally comes to a stop. A car or a scooter also comes to rest\nonce its engine is switched off. Similarly,\na boat comes to rest if we stop rowing\nit. Can you add some more such\nexperiences? In all these situations no force\nappears to be acting on the objects, yet\ntheir speed gradually decreases and\nthey come to rest after some time. What\ncauses a change in their state of motion? Could some force be acting on them! Can you guess the direction in which\nthe force must be acting in each case? The force responsible for changing the\nstate of motion of objects in all these\nexamples is the force of friction. It is the\nforce of friction between the surface of\nthe ball and the ground that brings the\nmoving ball to rest."}
{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 102, "content": "Similarly, friction\nbetween water and the boat brings it to\na stop once you stop rowing. The force of friction always acts on\nall the moving objects and its direction\nis always opposite to the direction of\nmotion.

You may be wondering whether it is\nessential for the agent applying a force\non an object to be always in contact with\nit.

Leaves and fruits also fall to the ground\nwhen they get detached from the plant. Have you ever wondered why it is so? When the coin is held in your hand it\nis at rest. As soon as it is released, it\nbegins to move downwards. It is clear that\nthe state of motion of the coin undergoes\na change. Can this happen without a\nforce acting on it? Which is this force? Does the magnet on the rollers begin\nto move when the other magnet is brought\nnear it? Does it always move in the\ndirection of the approaching magnet? What do these observations suggest? Does\nit mean that some force must be acting\nbetween the two magnets? You have learnt in Class VI that like\npoles of two magnets repel each other and\nunlike poles attract each other. Attraction\nor repulsion between objects can also be\nseen as another form of pull or push. Do\nyou have to bring the magnets in contact\nfor observing the force between them?

Try cutting vegetables with a blunt\nknife  and then with a sharp knife. Which\nis easier? Do you get the feeling that the area\nover which the force is applied (for\nexample, the pointed end of the nail)\nplays a role in making these tasks easier? The force acting on a unit area of a\nsurface is called pressure. pressure = force / area on which it acts\nAt this stage we consider only those\nforces which act perpendicular to the\nsurface on which the pressure is to\nbe computed.

In this game a person is\nblind-folded and has to catch the\nremaining players. How is the blind-\nfolded person able to guess which player\nis closest to her? Sound plays an important role in our\nlives. It helps us to communicate with\none another. We hear a variety of sounds\nin our surroundings. Make a list of sounds you hear in\nyour surroundings. In the music room of your school you\nhear the sounds produced by musical\ninstruments \nlike \nflute, \ntabla,\nharmonium, etc. (Fig. 10.1). How is sound produced? How does it\ntravel from one place to another? How\ndo we hear sound? Why are some sounds\nlouder than others?"}

Fig. 10.15 : Understanding action of an eardrum\n10.4 We Hear Sound through\nOur Ears\nThe shape of the outer part of the ear is\nlike a funnel. When sound enters it, it\ntravels down a canal at the end of which\nthere is a thin stretched membrane. It\nis called the eardrum. It performs an\nimportant function. To understand what\nthe eardrum does, let us build a tin-can\nmodel of the eardrum. Activity 10.10\nTake a plastic or tin-can. Cut its\nends.

{"source": "science_class_8.pdf", "chunk_id": 132, "content": "In which\ncase is the amplitude larger? Loudness of sound is proportional to\nthe square of the amplitude of the\nvibration producing the sound. For\nexample, if the amplitude becomes\ntwice, the loudness increases by a\nfactor of 4. The loudness is expressed\nin a unit called decibel (dB). The\nfollowing table gives some idea of the\nloudness of sound coming from\nvarious sources. Normal breathing\n10 dB\nSoft whisper (at 5m)\n30 dB\nNormal conversation\n60 dB\nBusy traffic\n70 dB\nAverage factory\n80 dB\nAbove 80 dB the noise becomes\nphysically painful. I wonder why my voice\nis different from that of\nmy teacher. Compare the sound of a baby with\nthat of an adult. Is there any difference? Even if two sounds are equally loud,\nthey differ in some way. Let us see how. Fig. 10.18 : Frequency \ndetermines \nthe\npitch of a sound\nThe loudness of sound depends on\nits amplitude. When the amplitude of\nvibration is large, the sound produced\nis loud. When the amplitude is small,\nthe sound produced is feeble. The frequency determines the\nshrillness or pitch of a sound. If the\nfrequency of vibration is higher we say\nthat the sound is shrill and has a higher\npitch. If the frequency of vibration is\nlower, we say that the sound has a lower\npitch. For example, a drum vibrates with\na low frequency. Therefore, it produces\n2024-25\nSCIENCE\n132\na low-pitched sound. On the other\nhand, a whistle has a high frequency\nand therefore, produces a sound of\nhigher pitch (Fig. 10.18). A bird makes\na high-pitched sound whereas a lion\nmakes a low-pitched roar. However, the\nroar of a lion is very loud while the\nsound of the bird is quite feeble."}

Can you say\nthat the frequency of the voice of a child\nis higher than that of an adult? Usually the voice of a woman has\na higher  frequency than that of a\nman. 10.6 Audible and Inaudible\nSounds\nWe know that we need a vibrating body\nfor the production of sound. Can we\nhear the sound of all vibrating bodies? The fact is that sounds of frequencies\nless than about 20 vibrations per second\n(20 Hz) cannot be detected by the  human\near. Such sounds are called inaudible. On the higher side, sounds of  frequencies\nhigher than about 20,000 vibrations per\nsecond (20 kHz) are also not audible to\nthe  human ear. Thus, for human ear,\nthe range of audible frequencies is\nroughly from 20 to 20,000 Hz. Some animals can hear sounds of\nfrequencies higher than 20,000 Hz. Dogs have this ability. The police use\nhigh frequency whistles which dogs can\nhear but humans cannot. The ultrasound equipment, familiar\nto us for investigating and tracking\nmany medical problems, works at\nfrequencies higher than 20,000 Hz. 10.7 Noise and Music\nWe hear different types of sounds\naround us. Is the sound always\npleasing? Does a sound sometimes\ncause discomfort to you? Some sounds\nare pleasant to the ear, whereas some\nare not. Suppose construction work is going\non in your neighbourhood. Are the\nsounds coming from the construction\nsite pleasing? Do you enjoy the sounds\nproduced by horns of buses and trucks? Such unpleasant sounds are called\nnoise. In a classroom, if all the students\nspeak together, what would the sound\nproduced be called? On the other hand you enjoy sounds\nfrom musical instruments."}

Presence of unwanted gases and\nparticles in air is called air pollution. Similarly, presence of excessive or\nunwanted sounds in the environment\nis called noise pollution. Can you list\nsome sources of noise pollution? Major\ncauses of noise pollution are sounds of\nvehicles, explosions including bursting\nof crackers, machines, loudspeakers etc. What sources in the home may lead to\nnoise? Television and transistor radio\nat high volumes, some kitchen\nappliances, desert coolers, air\nconditioners, all contribute to noise\npollution. 2024-25\nSOUND\n133\nHearing Impairment\nTotal hearing impairment, which is rare, is usually from birth itself. Partial\ndisability is generally the result of a disease, injury or age. Children with\nimpaired hearing need special care. By learning sign language, such children\ncan communicate effectively. Because speech develops as the direct result of\nhearing, a child with a hearing loss may have defective speech also. Technological devices for the hearing-impaired have made it possible for such\npersons to improve their quality of life. Society can do much to  improve the\nliving environment for the hearing-impaired and help them live normal lives. What are the Harms of Noise\nPollution? Do you know that presence of excessive\nnoise in the surroundings may cause\nmany health related problems. Lack of\nsleep, hypertension (high blood-\npressure), anxiety and many more health\ndisorders may be caused by noise\npollution. A person who is exposed to a\nloud sound continuously may get\ntemporary \nor \neven \npermanent\nimpairment of hearing."}

For this, silencing devices\nmust be installed in air craft engines,\ntransport vehicles, industrial\nmachines and home appliances. How can the noise pollution be\ncontrolled in a residential area? All noisy operations must be\nconducted away from any residential\narea. Noise producing industries\nshould be set up away from such\nareas. Use of automobile horns\nshould be minimised.

Can this apparatus\nbe used to detect whether a body is\ncharged or not? Can you explain\nwhy the foil strips repel each other? The aluminium foil strips receive the\nsame charge from the charged refill\nthrough the paper clip (remember that\nmetals are good conductors of\nelectricity). The strips carrying similar\ncharges repel each other and they\nbecome wide open. Such a device can\nbe used to test whether an object is\ncarrying charge or not. This device is\nknown as electroscope. Thus, we find that electrical charge\ncan be transferred from a charged object\nto another through a metal conductor.

Earthing is provided in buildings to\nprotect us from electrical shocks due\nto any leakage of electrical current. 12.5 The Story of Lightning\nIt is now possible to explain lightning\nin terms of the charges produced by\nrubbing. During the development of a\nthunderstorm, the air currents move\nupward while the water droplets move\ndownward. These vigorous movements\ncause separation of charges. By a\nprocess, not yet completely understood,\nthe positive charges collect near the\nupper edges of the clouds and the\nnegative charges accumulate near the\nlower edges. There is accumulation of\npositive charges near the ground also. When \nthe \nmagnitude \nof \nthe\naccumulated charges becomes very\nlarge, the air which is normally a poor\nconductor of electricity, is no longer able\nto resist their flow. Negative and positive\ncharges meet, producing streaks of\nbright light and sound. We see streaks\nas lightning (Fig. 12.5). The process is\ncalled an electric discharge. Fig. 12.5 : Accumulation of charges leading to lightning. 2024-25\nSOME NATURAL PHENOMENA\n155\nThe process of electric discharge can\noccur between two or more clouds, or\nbetween clouds and the earth. Today we\nneed not get frightened by lightning like\nour ancestors did. Now we understand\nthe basic phenomenon. Scientists are\ntrying \nhard \nto \nimprove \nthis\nunderstanding. However, lightning\nstrike could destroy life and property. It\nis, therefore, necessary to take measures\nto protect ourselves. 12.6 Lightning Safety\nDuring lightning and thunderstorm no\nopen place is safe. l\nHearing thunder is an alert to rush\nto a safer place."}

We\ncan observe that all these have a definite\nshape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes,\nthat is, have negligible compressibility. Solids\nhave a tendency to maintain their shape when\nsubjected to outside force. Solids may break\nunder force but it is difficult to change their\nshape, so they are rigid. Consider the following:\n(a) What about a rubber band, can it\nchange its shape on stretching? Is it\na solid? (b) What about sugar and salt? When\nkept in different jars these take the\nshape of the jar. Are they solid? (c) What about a sponge? It is a solid\nyet we are able to compress it. Why? All the above are solids as:\n\u2022\nA rubber band changes shape under\nforce and regains the same shape when\nthe force is removed. If excessive force is\napplied, it breaks."}

We observe that liquids have no fixed\nshape but have a fixed volume. They take up\nthe shape of the container in which they are\nkept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they\nare not rigid but can be called fluid. Refer  to activities 1.4 and 1.5 where we\nsaw that solids and liquids can diffuse into\nliquids. The gases from the atmosphere\ndiffuse and dissolve in water. These gases,\nespecially oxygen and carbon dioxide, are\nessential for the survival of aquatic animals\nand plants. All living creatures need to breathe for\nsurvival. The aquatic animals can breathe\nunder water due to the presence of dissolved\noxygen  in water. Thus, we may conclude that\nsolids, liquids and gases can diffuse into\nliquids. The rate of diffusion of liquids is\nReprint 2025-26\nMATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS\n5\nhigher than that of solids."}

We need answers to these questions,\nisn\u2019t it?

On increasing the temperature of solids,\nthe kinetic energy of the particles increases. Due to the increase in kinetic energy, the\nparticles start vibrating with greater speed. The energy supplied by heat overcomes the\nforces of attraction between the particles. The\nparticles leave their fixed positions and start\nmoving more freely."}
{"source": "science_class_9.pdf", "chunk_id": 10, "content": "A stage is reached when\nthe solid melts and is converted to a liquid. The minimum temperature at which a solid\nmelts to become a liquid at the atmospheric\npressure is called its melting point. The melting point of a solid is an indication\nof the strength of the force of attraction\nbetween its particles. The melting point of ice is 273.15 K*. The\nprocess of melting, that is, change of solid\nstate into liquid state is also known as fusion. When a solid melts, its temperature\nremains the same, so where does the heat\nenergy go? You must have observed, during the\nexperiment of melting, that the temperature\nof the system does not change after the\nmelting point is reached, till all the ice melts. This happens even though we continue to\nheat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply\nheat. This heat gets used up in changing the\nstate by overcoming the forces of attraction\nbetween the particles. As this heat energy is\nabsorbed by ice without showing any rise in\ntemperature, it is considered that it gets\nhidden into the contents of the beaker and is\nknown as the latent heat. The word latent\nmeans hidden. The amount of heat energy\nthat is required to change 1 kg of a solid into\nliquid at atmospheric pressure at its melting\npoint is known as the latent heat of fusion. So, particles in water at 0oC (273 K) have more\nenergy as compared to particles in ice at the\nsame temperature. When we supply heat energy to water,\nparticles start moving even faster. At a certain\ntemperature, a point is reached when the\nparticles have enough energy to break free\nfrom the forces of attraction of each other. At\nthis temperature the liquid starts changing\ninto gas."}

Boiling is a bulk\nphenomenon. Particles from the bulk of the\nliquid gain enough energy to change into the\nvapour state. For water this temperature is 373 K\n(100oC = 273 + 100 = 373 K). Can you define the latent heat of\nvaporisation? Do it in the same way as we\nhave defined the latent heat of fusion. Particles in steam, that is, water vapour at\n373 K (1000 C) have more energy than water\nat the same temperature. This is because\nparticles in steam have absorbed extra energy\nin the form of latent heat of vaporisation. *Note: Kelvin is the SI unit of temperature, 0o C =273.15 K. For convenience, we take 0o C = 273 K after\nrounding off the decimal. To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale you\nhave to subtract 273 from the given temperature, and to convert a temperature on the Celsius\nscale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature. So, we infer that the state of matter can\nbe changed into another state by changing\nthe temperature.

But, for a scientist all these things\nare actually mixtures of different substances\nand hence not pure. For example, milk is\nactually a mixture of water, fat, proteins, etc. When a scientist says that something is pure,\nit means that all the constituent particles of\nthat substance are the same in their chemical\nnature. A pure substance consists of a single\ntype of particle. In other words, a substance is\na pure single form of matter. As we look around, we can see that most\nof the matter around us exists as mixtures of\ntwo or more pure components, for example,\nsea water, minerals, soil, etc., are all mixtures. 2.1 What is a Mixture? Mixtures  are constituted by more than one\nkind of pure form of matter. We know that\ndissolved sodium chloride can be separated\nfrom water by the physical process of\nevaporation. However, sodium chloride is itself\na pure substance and cannot be separated by\nphysical process into its chemical constituents. Similarly, sugar is a substance which contains\nonly one kind of pure matter and its\ncomposition is the same throughout. Soft drink and soil are not single pure\nsubstances. Whatever the source of a\npure substance may be, it will always have\nthe same characteristic properties. Therefore, we can say that a mixture\ncontains more than one pure substance."}

So,\nthey cannot be seen by naked eyes. \u2022\nBecause of very small particle size, they\ndo not scatter a beam of light passing\nthrough the solution. So, the path of\nlight is not visible in a solution. \u2022\nThe solute particles cannot be separated\nfrom the mixture by the process of\nfiltration. The solute particles do not\nsettle down when left undisturbed, that\nis, a solution is stable. 2.2.1 CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION\nIn activity 2.2, we observed that groups A and\nB obtained different shades of solutions. So,\nwe understand that in a solution the relative\nproportion of the solute and solvent can be\nvaried. Depending upon the amount of solute\npresent in a solution, it can be called  dilute,\nconcentrated or  saturated solution. Dilute\nand concentrated are comparative terms. In\nactivity 2.2, the solution obtained by group\nA is dilute as compared to that obtained by\ngroup B.

They can be\nseparated from the mixture by the\nprocess of filtration. When the particles\nsettle down, the suspension breaks and\nit does not scatter light any more. 2.2.3 WHAT IS A COLLOIDAL SOLUTION? The mixture obtained by group D in activity\n2.2 is called a colloid or a colloidal solution. The particles of a colloid are uniformly spread\nthroughout the solution. Due to the relatively\nsmaller size of particles, as compared to that of\na suspension, the mixture appears to be\nhomogeneous. But actually, a colloidal solution\nis a heterogeneous mixture, for example, milk. Because of the small size of colloidal\nparticles, we cannot see them with naked eyes. But, these particles can easily scatter a beam\nof visible light as observed in activity 2.2. This\nscattering of a beam of light is called the\nTyndall effect after the name of the scientist\nwho discovered this effect. Tyndall effect can also be observed when a\nfine beam of light enters a room through a small\nhole. This happens due to the scattering of light\nby the particles of dust and smoke in the air.

Both water and cooking oil  are liquid but\ntheir chemical characteristics are different. They differ in odour and inflammability. We\nknow that oil burns in air whereas water\nextinguishes fire. It is this chemical property\nof oil that makes it different from water. Burning is a chemical change.

Examples of metals are gold, silver,\ncopper, iron, sodium, potassium etc. Mercury\nis the only metal that is liquid at room\ntemperature. Non-metals usually show some or all of the\nfollowing properties:\n\u2022\nThey display a variety of colours. \u2022\nThey are poor conductors of heat and\nelectricity."}

{"source": "science_class_9.pdf", "chunk_id": 33, "content": "The idea of divisibility\nof matter was considered long back in India,\naround 500 BC. An Indian philosopher\nMaharishi Kanad, postulated that if we go on\ndividing matter (padarth), we shall get smaller\nand smaller particles. Ultimately, a stage will\ncome when we shall come across the smallest\nparticles beyond which further division will\nnot be possible. He named these particles\nParmanu. Another Indian philosopher,\nPakudha Katyayama, elaborated this doctrine\nand said that these particles normally exist\nin a combined form which gives us various\nforms of matter. Around the same era, ancient Greek\nphilosophers \u2013 Democritus and Leucippus\nsuggested that if we go on dividing matter, a\nstage will come when particles obtained\ncannot be divided further. Democritus called\nthese indivisible particles atoms (meaning\nindivisible). All this was based on\nphilosophical considerations and not much\nexperimental work to validate these ideas\ncould be done till the eighteenth century. By the end of the eighteenth century,\nscientists recognised the difference between\nelements and compounds and naturally\nbecame interested in finding out how and why\nelements combine and what happens when\nthey combine. Antoine L. Lavoisier laid the foundation\nof chemical sciences by establishing two\nimportant laws of chemical combination. 3.1 Laws of Chemical Combination\nThe following two laws of chemical\ncombination were established after\nmuch experimentations by Lavoisier and\nJoseph L. Proust. 3.1.1 LAW OF CONSERVATION OF MASS\nIs there a change in mass when a chemical\nchange (chemical reaction) takes place?

In a compound such as water, the ratio of\nthe mass of hydrogen to the mass of oxygen is\nalways 1:8, whatever the source of water. Thus,\nif 9 g of water is decomposed, 1 g of hydrogen\nand 8 g of oxygen are always obtained. Similarly in ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen\nare always present in the ratio 14:3 by mass,\nwhatever the method or the source from which\nit is obtained."}

This law was stated by Proust as\n\u201cIn a chemical substance the elements are\nalways present in definite proportions by\nmass\u201d. The next problem faced by scientists was\nto give appropriate explanations of these laws. British chemist John Dalton provided the\nbasic theory about the nature of matter. Dalton picked up the idea of divisibility of\nmatter, which was till then just a philosophy. He took the name \u2018atoms\u2019 as given by the\nGreeks and said that the smallest particles of\nmatter are atoms. His theory was based on the\nlaws of chemical combination. Dalton\u2019s atomic\ntheory provided an explanation for the law of\nconservation of mass and the law of\ndefinite proportions. John Dalton was born in\na poor weaver\u2019s family in\n1766 in England. He\nbegan his career as a\nteacher at the age of\ntwelve. Seven years later\nhe became a school\nprincipal. In 1793, Dalton\nleft for Manchester to\nteach \nmathematics,\nphysics and chemistry in\na college. He spent most of his life there\nteaching and researching. In 1808, he\npresented his atomic theory which was a\nturning point in the study of matter. According to Dalton\u2019s atomic theory, all\nmatter, whether an element, a compound or\na mixture is composed of small particles called\natoms. The postulates of this theory may be\nstated as follows:\n(i)\nAll matter is made of very tiny particles\ncalled atoms, which participate in\nchemical reactions. (ii)\nAtoms are indivisible particles, which\ncannot be created or destroyed in a\nchemical reaction. (iii)\nAtoms of a given element are identical\nin mass and chemical properties.

Dalton was the first scientist to use the\nsymbols for elements in a very specific sense. When he used a symbol for an element he\nalso meant a definite quantity of that element,\nthat is, one atom of that element. Berzilius\nsuggested that the symbols of elements be\nmade from one or two letters of the name of\nthe element. Fig. 3.3: Symbols for some elements as proposed by\nDalton\nReprint 2025-26\nATOMS AND MOLECULES\n29\nIn the beginning, the names of elements\nwere derived from the name of the place\nwhere they were found for the first time. For\nexample, the name copper was taken from\nCyprus. Some names were taken from\nspecific colours. For example, gold was taken\nfrom the English word meaning yellow. Now-a-days, IUPAC (International Union of\nPure and Applied Chemistry) is an\ninternational scientific organisation which\napproves names of elements, symbols and\nunits. Many of the symbols are the first one\nor two letters of the element\u2019s name in\nEnglish. The first letter of a symbol is always\nwritten as a capital letter (uppercase) and the\nsecond letter as a small letter (lowercase)."}

Symbols of some elements are formed from\nthe first letter of the name and a letter,\nappearing later in the name. Examples are: (i)\nchlorine, Cl, (ii) zinc, Zn etc. Other symbols have been taken from the\nnames of elements in Latin, German or Greek. For example, the symbol of iron is Fe from its\nLatin name ferrum, sodium is Na from natrium,\npotassium is K from kalium. Therefore, each\nelement has a name and a unique\nchemical symbol. (The above table is given for you to refer to\nwhenever you study about elements. Do not\nbother to memorise all in one go. With the\npassage of time and repeated usage you will\nautomatically be able to reproduce\nthe symbols). 3.2.2 ATOMIC MASS\nThe most remarkable concept that Dalton\u2019s\natomic theory proposed was that of the atomic\nmass. According to him, each element had a\ncharacteristic atomic mass. The theory could\nexplain the law of constant proportions so well\nthat scientists were prompted to measure the\natomic mass of an atom. Since determining the\nmass of an individual atom was a relatively\ndifficult task, relative atomic masses were\ndetermined using the laws of chemical\ncombinations and the compounds formed. Let us take the example of a compound,\ncarbon monoxide (CO) formed by carbon and\noxygen. It was observed experimentally that 3\ng of carbon combines with 4 g of oxygen to\nform CO. In other words, carbon combines\nwith 4/3 times its mass of oxygen."}

One atomic mass\nunit is a mass unit equal to exactly one-twelfth\n(1/12th) the mass of one atom of carbon-12. The relative atomic masses of all elements\nhave been found with respect to an atom of\ncarbon-12. Imagine a fruit seller selling fruits without\nany standard weight with him.

Does the comb then\nattract small pieces of paper? B. Rub a glass rod with a silk cloth and\nbring the rod near an inflated balloon. Observe what happens. From these activities, can we conclude\nthat on rubbing two objects together, they\nbecome electrically charged? Where does this\ncharge come from? This question can be\nanswered by knowing that an atom is divisible\nand consists of charged particles. Many scientists contributed in revealing\nthe presence of charged particles in an atom. It was known by 1900 that the atom was\nindivisible particle but contained at least one\nsub-atomic particle \u2013 the electron identified by\nJ.J. Thomson. Even before the electron was\nidentified, E. Goldstein in 1886 discovered the\npresence of new radiations  in a gas discharge\nand called them canal rays. These rays were\npositively charged radiations which ultimately\nled to the discovery of another sub-atomic\nparticle. This sub-atomic particle had a charge,\nequal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that\nof the electron. Its mass was approximately\n2000 times as that of the electron. It was given\nthe name of proton. In general, an electron is\nrepresented as \u2018e\u2013\u2019 and a proton as \u2018p+\u2019. The\nmass of a proton is taken as one unit and its\ncharge as plus one. The mass of an electron is\nconsidered to be negligible and its charge is\nminus one.

But the\ndiscovery of two fundamental particles\n(electrons and protons) inside the atom, led\nto the failure of this aspect of Dalton\u2019s atomic\ntheory. It was then considered necessary to\nknow how electrons and protons are arranged\nwithin an atom. For explaining this, many\nscientists proposed various atomic models. J.J. Thomson was the first one to propose a\nmodel for the structure of an atom. 4.2.1 THOMSON\u2019S MODEL OF AN ATOM\nThomson proposed the model of an atom to\nbe similar to that of a Christmas pudding. The electrons, in a sphere of positive charge,\nwere like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical\nChristmas pudding. We can also think of a\nwatermelon, the positive charge in the atom\nis spread all over like the red edible part of\nthe watermelon, while the electrons are\nstudded in the positively charged sphere, like\nthe seeds in the watermelon (Fig. 4.1). Thomson proposed that:\n(i)\nAn atom consists of a positively\ncharged sphere and the electrons are\nembedded in it."}
{"source": "science_class_9.pdf", "chunk_id": 51, "content": "(ii)\nThe negative and positive charges are\nequal in magnitude. So, the atom as a\nwhole is electrically neutral. Although Thomson\u2019s model explained that\natoms are electrically neutral, the results of\nexperiments carried out by other scientists\ncould not be explained by this model, as we\nwill see below. 4.2.2 RUTHERFORD\u2019S MODEL OF AN ATOM\nErnest Rutherford was interested in knowing\nhow the electrons are arranged within an\natom. Rutherford designed an experiment for\nthis. In this experiment, fast moving alpha\n(\u03b1)-particles were made to fall on a thin\ngold foil. \u2022\nHe selected a gold foil because he wanted\nas thin a layer as possible. This gold foil\nwas about 1000 atoms thick. \u2022\n\u03b1-particles are doubly-charged helium\nions. Since they have a mass of 4 u, the\nfast-moving \n\u03b1-particles \nhave \na\nconsiderable amount of energy. \u2022\nIt was expected that \u03b1-particles would be\ndeflected by the sub-atomic particles in\nthe gold atoms. Since the \u03b1-particles were\nmuch heavier than the protons, he did\nnot expect to see large deflections. Q\nFig.4.1: Thomson\u2019s model of an atom\nJ.J. Thomson (1856\u2013\n1940), \n \na \nBritish\nphysicist, was born in\nCheetham Hill, a suburb\nof \nManchester, \non\n18 December 1856. He\nwas awarded the Nobel\nprize in Physics in 1906\nfor his work on the\ndiscovery of electrons.

In the words of Rutherford, \u201cThis result\nwas almost as incredible as if you fire a\n15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it\ncomes back and hits you\u201d. He will hear a sound when each stone strikes\nthe wall. If he repeats this ten times, he will\nhear the sound ten times. But if a blind-folded\nchild were to throw stones at a barbed-wire\nfence, most of the stones would not hit the\nfencing and no sound would be heard. This is\nbecause there are lots of gaps in the fence\nwhich allow the stone to pass through them. Following a similar reasoning, Rutherford\nconcluded from the \u03b1-particle scattering\nexperiment that\u2014\n(i)\nMost of the space inside the atom is\nempty because most of the \u03b1-particles\npassed through the gold foil without\ngetting deflected.

(iii)\nA very small fraction of \u03b1-particles\nwere deflected by 1800, indicating that\nall the positive charge and mass of the\ngold atom were concentrated in a very\nsmall volume within the atom. From the data he also calculated that the\nradius of the nucleus is about 105 times less\nthan the radius of the atom. On the basis of his experiment,\nRutherford put forward the nuclear model of\nan atom, which had the following features:\n(i)\nThere is a positively charged centre in\nan atom called the nucleus. Nearly all\nthe mass of an atom resides in the\nnucleus. (ii)\nThe electrons revolve around the\nnucleus in circular paths.

{"source": "science_class_9.pdf", "chunk_id": 68, "content": "We saw above that the cell has special\ncomponents called organelles. How is a cell\norganised? If we study a cell under a microscope, we\nwould come across three features in almost\nevery cell; plasma membrane, nucleus and\ncytoplasm. All activities inside the cell and\ninteractions of the cell with its environment\nare possible due to these features. Let us see\nhow. 5.2.1 PLASMA MEMBRANE OR CELL\nMEMBRANE\nThis is the outermost covering of the cell that\nseparates the contents of the cell from its\nexternal environment. The plasma membrane\nallows or permits the entry and exit of some\nmaterials in and out of the cell. It also\nprevents movement of some other materials. The cell membrane, therefore, is called a\nselectively permeable membrane. How does the movement of substances\ntake place into the cell? How do substances\nmove out of the cell? Some substances like carbon dioxide or\noxygen can move across the cell membrane\nby a process called diffusion. We have studied\nthe process of diffusion in earlier chapters. We saw that there is spontaneous movement\nof a substance from a region of high\nconcentration to a region where its\nconcentration is low. Something similar to this happens in cells\nwhen, for example, some substance like CO2\n(which is cellular waste and requires to be\nexcreted out by the cell) accumulates in high\nconcentrations inside the cell. In the cell\u2019s\nexternal environment, the concentration of\nCO2 is low as compared to that inside the\ncell. As soon as there is a difference of\nconcentration of CO2 inside and outside a cell,\nCO2 moves out of the cell, from a region of\nhigh concentration, to a region of low\nconcentration outside the cell by the process\nof diffusion."}
{"source": "science_class_9.pdf", "chunk_id": 69, "content": "Similarly, O2 enters the cell by\nthe process of diffusion when the level or\nconcentration of O2 inside the cell decreases. Thus, diffusion plays an important role in\ngaseous exchange between the cells as well\nas the cell and its external environment. Water also obeys the law of diffusion. The\nmovement of water molecules through such a\nselectively permeable membrane is called osmosis. Q\nReprint 2025-26\nSCIENCE\n52\n52\n52\n52\n52\nThe movement of water across the plasma\nmembrane is also affected by the\namount of substance dissolved in water. Thus,\nosmosis is the net diffusion of water across a\nselectively permeable membrane toward a\nhigher solute concentration. What will happen if we put an animal cell\nor a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt\nin water? One of the following three things could\nhappen:\n1. If the medium surrounding the cell has\na higher water concentration than the\ncell, meaning that the outside solution\nis very dilute, the cell will gain water by\nosmosis. Such a solution is known as\na hypotonic solution. Water molecules are free to pass\nacross the cell membrane in both\ndirections, but more water will come\ninto the cell than will leave. The net\n(overall) result is that water enters the\ncell. The cell is likely to swell up. 2. If the medium has exactly the same\nwater concentration as the cell, there\nwill be no net movement of water across\nthe cell membrane. Such a solution is\nknown as an isotonic solution. Water crosses the cell membrane in\nboth directions, but the amount going\nin is the same as the amount going out,\nso there is no overall movement of\nwater. The cell will stay the same size. 3."}

Such a solution is known as\na hypertonic solution. Again, water crosses the cell\nmembrane in both directions, but this\ntime more water leaves the cell than\nenters it. Therefore the cell will shrink. Thus, osmosis is a special case of diffusion\nthrough a selectively permeable membrane. Now let us try out the following activity:\nActivity ______________ 5.3\n(a)\nRemove the shell of an egg by\ndissolving it in dilute hydrochloric\nacid. The shell is mostly calcium\ncarbonate. A thin outer skin now\nencloses the egg. Put the egg in pure\nwater and observe after 5 minutes. What do we observe? The egg swells because water passes\ninto it by osmosis. (b)\nPlace a similar de-shelled egg in a\nconcentrated salt solution and observe\nfor 5 minutes. The egg shrinks. Why? Water passes out of the egg solution\ninto the salt solution because the salt\nsolution is more concentrated. We can also try a similar activity with dried\nraisins or apricots. Activity ______________ 5.4\n\u2022\nPut dried raisins or apricots in plain\nwater and leave them for some time. Then place them into a concentrated\nsolution of sugar or salt. You will\nobserve the following:\n(a)\nEach gains water and swells\nwhen placed in water. (b)\nHowever, when placed in the\nconcentrated solution it loses\nwater, and consequently shrinks. Unicellular freshwater organisms and\nmost plant cells tend to gain water through\nosmosis. Absorption of water by plant roots\nis also an example of osmosis. Thus, diffusion is important in exhange\nof gases and water in the life of a cell. In\nadditions to this, the cell also obtains\nnutrition from its environment."}

Cell walls permit the cells of plants, fungi\nand bacteria to withstand very dilute\n(hypotonic) external media without bursting. In such media the cells tend to take up water\nby osmosis.

The nuclear\nmembrane has pores which allow the transfer\nof material from inside the nucleus to its\noutside, that is, to the cytoplasm (which we\nwill talk about in section 5.2.4). The nucleus contains chromosomes,\nwhich are visible as rod-shaped structures\nonly when the cell is about to divide. Chromosomes contain information for\ninheritance of characters from parents to next\ngeneration in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo\nNucleic Acid) molecules. Chromosomes are\ncomposed of DNA and protein.

Large and complex cells,\nincluding cells from multicellular organisms,\nneed a lot of chemical activities to support\ntheir complicated structure and function. To\nkeep these activities of different kinds\nseparate from each other, these cells use\nmembrane-bound little structures (or\n\u2018organelles\u2019) within themselves. This is one of\nthe features of the eukaryotic cells that\ndistinguish them from prokaryotic cells. Some\nof these organelles are visible only with an\nelectron microscope. We have talked about the nucleus in a\nprevious section. Some important examples\nof cell organelles which we will discuss now\nare: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus,\nlysosomes, mitochondria and plastids. They\nare important because they carry out some\nvery crucial functions in cells. 5.2.5 (i) ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER)\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a large\nnetwork of membrane-bound tubes and\nsheets. It looks like long tubules or round or\noblong bags (vesicles). The ER membrane is\nsimilar in structure to the plasma membrane. There are two types of ER\u2013 rough endoplasmic\nreticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic\nreticulum (SER)."}

The SER helps in the\nmanufacture of fat molecules, or lipids,\nimportant for cell function. Some of these\nproteins and lipids help in building the cell\nmembrane. This process is known as\nmembrane biogenesis. Some other proteins\nand lipids function as enzymes and\nhormones.

He \nstudied\nmedicine at the University\nof Pavia. After graduating\nin 1865, he continued to\nwork in Pavia at the\nHospital of St. Matteo. At\nthat time most of his\ninvestigations \nwere\nconcerned with the nervous system, In 1872\nhe accepted the post of Chief Medical Officer\nat the Hospital for the Chronically Sick at\nAbbiategrasso. He first started his\ninvestigations into the nervous system in a\nlittle kitchen of this hospital, which he had\nconverted into a laboratory. However, the\nwork of greatest importance, which Golgi\ncarried out was a revolutionary method of\nstaining individual nerve and cell structures.

He shared\nthe Nobel prize in 1906 with Santiago\nRamony Cajal for their work on the structure\nof the nervous system. 5.2.5 (iii) LYSOSOMES\nStructurally, lysosomes are membrane-bound\nsacs filled with digestive enzymes. These\nenzymes are made by RER. Lysosomes are a\nkind of waste disposal system of the cell. These\nhelp to keep the cell clean by digesting any\nforeign material as well as worn-out cell\norganelles.

Mitochondria have two membrane\ncoverings. The outer membrane is porous\nwhile the inner membrane is deeply folded. These folds increase surface area for ATP-\ngenerating chemical reactions. The energy\nrequired for various chemical activities needed\nfor life is released by mitochondria in the form\nof ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) molecules. ATP is known as the energy currency of the\ncell. The body uses energy stored in ATP for\nmaking new chemical compounds and for\nmechanical work. Mitochondria are strange organelles in the\nsense that they have their own DNA and\nribosomes. Therefore, mitochondria are able\nto make some of their own proteins. 5.2.5 (V) PLASTIDS\nPlastids are present only in plant cells. There\nare two types of plastids \u2013 chromoplasts\n(coloured plastids) and leucoplasts (white or\ncolourless plastids). Chromoplasts containing\nthe pigment chlorophyll are known as\nchloroplasts. Chloroplasts are important for\nphotosynthesis in plants. Chloroplasts also\ncontain various yellow or orange pigments in\naddition to chlorophyll. Leucoplasts are\nprimarily organelles in which materials such\nas starch, oils and protein granules are stored.

Reprint 2025-26\nFrom the last chapter, we recall that all living\norganisms are made of cells. In unicellular\norganisms, a single cell performs all basic\nfunctions. For example, in Amoeba, a single\ncell carries out movement, intake of food,\ngaseous exchange and excretion. But in multi-\ncellular organisms there are millions of cells. Most of these cells are specialised to carry out\nspecific functions. Each specialised function\nis taken up by a different group of cells. Since\nthese cells carry out only a particular function,\nthey do it very efficiently. In human beings,\nmuscle cells contract and relax to cause\nmovement, nerve cells carry messages, blood\nflows to transport oxygen, food, hormones and\nwaste material and so on. In plants, vascular\ntissues conduct food and water from one part\nof the plant to other parts. So, multi-cellular\norganisms show division of labour. Cells\nspecialising in one function are often grouped\ntogether in the body. This means that a\nparticular function is carried out by a cluster\nof cells at a definite place in the body."}
{"source": "science_class_9.pdf", "chunk_id": 83, "content": "This\ncluster of cells, called a tissue, is arranged and\ndesigned so as to give the highest possible\nefficiency of function. Blood, phloem and\nmuscle are all examples of tissues. A group of cells that are similar in structure\nand/or work together to achieve a particular\nfunction forms a tissue. 6.1 Are Plants and Animals Made\nof Same Types of Tissues? Let us compare their structure and functions. Do plants and animals have the same\nstructure? Do they both perform similar\nfunctions? There are noticeable differences between\nthe two. Plants are stationary or fixed \u2013 they\ndon\u2019t move. Since they have to be upright, they\nhave a large quantity of supportive tissue. The\nsupportive tissue generally has dead cells. Animals on the other hand move around\nin search of food, mates and shelter. They\nconsume more energy as compared to plants. Most of the tissues they contain are living. Another difference between animals and\nplants is in the pattern of growth. The growth\nin plants is limited to certain regions, while this\nis not so in animals. There are some tissues in\nplants that divide throughout their life. These\ntissues are localised in certain regions. Based\non the dividing capacity of the tissues, various\nplant tissues can be classified as growing or\nmeristematic tissue and permanent tissue. Cell\ngrowth in animals is more uniform. So, there\nis no such demarcation of dividing and non-\ndividing regions in animals. The structural organisation of organs and\norgan systems is far more specialised and\nlocalised in complex animals than even in very\ncomplex plants.

On the basis of  the\nfunctions they perform we can think of different\ntypes of animal tissues, such as epithelial\ntissue, connective tissue, muscular tissue and\nnervous tissue. Blood is a type of connective\ntissue, and muscle forms muscular tissue. 6.3.1 EPITHELIAL TISSUE\nThe covering or protective tissues in the animal\nbody are epithelial tissues. Epithelium covers\nmost organs and cavities within the body. It\nalso forms a barrier to keep different body\nsystems separate. The skin, the lining of the\nmouth, the lining of blood vessels, lung alveoli\nand kidney tubules are all made of epithelial\ntissue. Epithelial tissue cells are tightly packed\nand form a continuous sheet. They have only\na small amount of cementing material between\nthem and almost no intercellular spaces. Obviously, anything entering or leaving the\nbody must cross at least one layer of\nepithelium. As a result, the permeability of the\ncells of various epithelia play an important role\nin regulating the exchange of materials\nbetween the body and the external\nenvironment and also between different parts\nof the body."}
{"source": "science_class_9.pdf", "chunk_id": 91, "content": "Regardless of the type, all\nepithelium is usually separated from the\nunderlying tissue by an extracellular fibrous\nbasement membrane. Different epithelia (Fig. 6.9) show differing\nstructures that correlate with their unique\nfunctions. For example, in cells lining blood\nvessels or lung alveoli, where transportation\nof substances occurs through a selectively\npermeable surface, there is a simple flat kind\nReprint 2025-26\nSCIENCE\n66\nFig. 6.9: Different types of epithelial tissues\nof skin). Simple squamous epithelial cells are\nextremely thin and flat and form a delicate\nlining. The oesophagus and the lining of the\nmouth are also covered with squamous\nepithelium. The skin, which protects the body,\nis also made of squamous epithelium. Skin\nepithelial cells are arranged in many layers to\nprevent wear and tear. Since they are arranged\nin a pattern of layers, the epithelium is called\nstratified squamous epithelium. Where absorption and secretion occur, as\nin the inner lining of the intestine, tall epithelial\ncells are present. This columnar (meaning\n\u2018pillar-like\u2019) epithelium facilitates movement\nacross the epithelial barrier. In the respiratory\ntract, the columnar epithelial tissue also has\ncilia, which are hair-like projections on the\nouter surfaces of epithelial cells. These cilia can\nmove, and their movement pushes the mucus\nforward to clear it. This type of epithelium is\nthus ciliated columnar epithelium. Cuboidal epithelium (with cube-shaped\ncells) forms the lining of kidney tubules and\nducts of salivary glands, where it provides\nmechanical support. Epithelial cells often\nacquire additional specialisation as gland cells,\nwhich can secrete substances at the epithelial\nsurface. Sometimes a portion of the epithelial\ntissue folds inward, and a multicellular gland\nis formed. This is glandular epithelium. 6.3.2 CONNECTIVE TISSUE\nBlood is a type of connective tissue.

As\nyou have studied in mathematics, a straight\nline graph helps in solving a linear equation\nhaving two variables. To describe the motion of an object, we\ncan use line graphs.

In this graph, time is taken along the x\u2013axis\nand distance is taken along the y-axis. Distance-time graphs can be employed under\nvarious conditions where objects move with\nuniform speed, non-uniform speed, remain\nat rest etc. Fig. 7.3:\nFig. 7.3:\nFig. 7.3:\nFig. 7.3:\nFig. 7.3: Distance-time graph of an object moving\nwith uniform speed\nWe know that when an object travels equal\ndistances in equal intervals of time, it moves\nwith uniform speed."}

Thus, for uniform\nspeed, a graph of distance travelled against\ntime is a straight line, as shown in Fig. 7.3. The portion OB of the graph shows that the\ndistance is increasing at a uniform rate. Note\nthat, you can also use the term uniform\nvelocity in place of uniform speed if you take\nthe magnitude of displacement equal to the\ndistance travelled by the object along the\ny-axis. We can use the distance-time graph to\ndetermine the speed of an object. To do so,\nconsider a small part AB of the distance-time\ngraph shown in Fig 7.3. Draw a line parallel\nto the x-axis from point A and another line\nparallel to the y-axis from point B. These two\nlines meet each other at point C to form a\ntriangle ABC.

Such\nobservations suggest that rest is the \u201cnatural\nstate\u201d of an object.

This friction\nforce arises between two surfaces in contact;\nin this case, between the bottom of the box\nand floor\u2019s rough surface. It balances the\npushing force and therefore the box does not\nmove. In Fig. 8.4(b), the children push the box\nharder but the box still does not move. This is\nbecause the friction force still balances the\npushing force. If the children push the box\nharder still, the pushing force becomes bigger\nthan the friction force [Fig. 8.4(c)]. There is an unbalanced force. So the box\nstarts moving. What happens when we ride a bicycle? When we stop pedalling, the bicycle begins\nto slow down. This is again because of the\nfriction forces acting opposite to the direction\nof motion. In order to keep the bicycle moving,\nwe have to start pedalling again. It thus\nappears that an  object maintains its motion\nunder the continuous application of an\nunbalanced force. However, it is quite\nincorrect.

He observed that when a marble\nrolls down an inclined plane, its velocity\nincreases [Fig. 8.5(a)]. In the next chapter, you\nwill learn that the marble falls under the\nunbalanced force of gravity as it rolls down\nand attains a definite velocity by the time it\nreaches the bottom. Its velocity decreases\nwhen it climbs up as shown in Fig. 8.5(b). Fig. 8.5(c) shows a marble resting on an ideal\nfrictionless plane inclined on both sides. Galileo argued that when the marble is\nreleased from left, it would roll down the slope\nand go up on the opposite side to the same\nheight from which it was released. If the\ninclinations of the planes on both sides are\nequal then the marble will climb the same\ndistance that it covered while rolling down. If\nthe angle of inclination of the right-side plane\nwere gradually decreased, then the marble\nwould travel further distances till it reaches\nthe original height. If the right-side plane were\nultimately made horizontal (that is, the slope\nis reduced to zero), the marble would continue\nto travel forever trying to reach the same\nheight that it was released from. The\nunbalanced forces on the marble in this case\nare zero. It thus suggests that an unbalanced\n(external) force is required to change the\nmotion of the marble but no net force is\nneeded to sustain the uniform motion of the\nmarble. In practical situations it is difficult\nto achieve a zero unbalanced force. This is\nbecause of the presence of the frictional force\nacting opposite to the direction of motion."}

Newton further studied Galileo\u2019s ideas on\nforce and motion and presented three\nfundamental laws that govern the motion of\nobjects. These three laws are known as\nNewton\u2019s laws of motion. The first law of\nmotion is stated as:\nAn object remains in a state of rest or of\nuniform motion in a straight line unless\ncompelled to change that state by an\napplied force. In other words, all objects resist a change\nin their state of motion. In a qualitative way,\nthe tendency of undisturbed objects to stay\nat rest or to keep moving with the same\nvelocity is called inertia. This is why, the first\nlaw of motion is also known as the law\nof inertia. Certain experiences that we come across\nwhile travelling in a motorcar can be\nexplained on the basis of the law of inertia. We tend to remain at rest with respect to the\nseat until the driver applies a braking force\nto stop the motorcar. With the application of\nbrakes, the car slows down but our body\ntends to continue in the same state of motion\nbecause of its inertia.

Now\nwe tend to fall backwards. This is because the\nsudden start of the bus brings motion to the\nbus as well as to our feet in contact with the\nfloor of the bus. But the rest of our body\nopposes this motion because of its inertia. When a motorcar makes a sharp turn at a\nhigh speed, we tend to get thrown to one side. This can again be explained on the basis of\nthe law of inertia. We tend to continue in our\nstraight-line motion. When an unbalanced\nforce is applied by the engine to change the\ndirection of motion of the motorcar, we slip to\none side of the seat due to the inertia of\nour body.

Example 8.4 A force of 5 N gives a mass\nm1, an acceleration of 10 m s\u20132 and a\nmass m2, an acceleration of 20 m s-2. What acceleration would it give if both\nthe masses were tied together? Solution:\nFrom Eq. (8.4) we have m1 = F/a1; and\nm2 = F/a2. Here, a1 = 10 m s-2;\na2 = 20 m s-2 and F = 5 N.\nThus,  m1 = 5 N/10 m s-2 = 0.50 kg; and\nm2 = 5 N/20 m s-2 = 0.25 kg. If the two masses were tied together,\nthe total mass, m would be\nm = 0.50 kg + 0.25 kg = 0.75 kg. The acceleration, a produced in the\ncombined mass by the 5 N force would\nbe, a = F/m = 5 N/0.75 kg = 6.67 m s-2.

These two forces are always\nequal in magnitude but opposite in direction. These forces act on different objects and never\non the same object.

Another concept that helps us understand and\ninterpret many natural phenomena is \u2018work\u2019. Closely related to work are energy and power. In this chapter we shall study these concepts. All living beings need food. Living beings\nhave to perform several basic activities to\nsurvive. We call such activities \u2018life processes\u2019. The energy for these processes comes from\nfood. We need energy for other activities like\nplaying, singing, reading, writing, thinking,\njumping, cycling and running. Activities that\nare strenuous require more energy. Animals too get engaged in activities. For\nexample, they may jump and run. They have\nto fight, move away from enemies, find food\nor find a safe place to live. Also, we engage\nsome animals to lift weights, carry loads, pull\ncarts or plough fields. All such activities\nrequire energy. Think of machines. List the machines that\nyou have come across. What do they need for\ntheir working? Why do some engines require\nfuel like petrol and diesel? Why do living\nbeings and machines need energy? 10.1 Work\nWhat is work? There is a difference in the\nway we use the term \u2018work\u2019 in day-to-day life\nand the way we use it in science. To make\nthis point clear let us consider a few examples. 10.1.1 NOT MUCH \u2018WORK\u2019 IN SPITE OF\nWORKING HARD! Kamali is preparing for examinations. She\nspends lot of time in studies. She reads books,\ndraws diagrams, organises her thoughts,\ncollects question papers, attends classes,\ndiscusses problems with her friends, and\nperforms experiments. She expends a lot of\nenergy on these activities. In common\nparlance, she is \u2018working hard\u2019."}

You are working hard to push a huge rock. Let us say the rock does not move despite all\nthe effort. You get completely exhausted. However, you have not done any work on the\nrock as there is no displacement of the rock. You stand still for a few minutes with a\nheavy load on your head. You get tired. You\nhave exerted yourself and have spent quite a\nbit of your energy. Are you doing work on the\nload? The way we understand the term \u2018work\u2019\nin science, work is not done. You climb up the steps of a staircase and\nreach the second floor of a building just to\nsee the landscape from there. You may even\nclimb up a tall tree. If we apply the scientific\ndefinition, these activities involve a lot of work. In day-to-day life, we consider any useful\nphysical or mental labour as work.

To\nunderstand this, we shall first consider the\ncase when the force is acting in the direction\nof displacement. Let a constant force, F act on an object. Let the object be displaced through a\ndistance, s in the direction of the force (Fig. 10.1). Let W be the work done. We define work\nto be equal to the product of the force and\ndisplacement.

A girl pulls a trolley and the trolley moves\nthrough a distance. The girl has exerted a\nforce on the trolley and it is displaced. Therefore, work is done. Lift a book through a height. To do this\nyou must apply a force. The book rises up. There is a force applied on the book and the\nbook has moved. Hence, work is done."}

What happens to the total\nenergy of a system during or after the process? Whenever energy gets transformed, the total\nenergy remains unchanged. This is the law of\nconservation of energy.

The law\nof conservation of energy is valid                  in\nall situations and for all kinds of\ntransformations. Consider a simple example. Let an object\nof mass, m be made to fall freely from a     height,\nh. At the start, the potential energy is mgh and\nkinetic energy is zero. Why is the kinetic\nenergy zero? It is zero because its velocity is\nzero. The total energy of the object is thus mgh. As it falls, its potential energy will change into\nkinetic energy."}

As the fall of the object continues, the\npotential energy would decrease while the\nkinetic energy would increase. When the object\nis about to reach the ground, h = 0 and v will\nbe the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy\nwould be the largest and potential energy the\nleast. However, the sum of the potential energy\nand kinetic energy of the object would be the\nsame at all points. That is,\npotential energy + kinetic energy = constant\n   or\n1\nconstant. 2\n2\nmgh +\nmv =\n(10.7)\nThe sum of kinetic energy and potential energy\nof an object is its total mechanical energy. We find that during the free fall of the object,\nthe decrease in potential energy, at any point\nin its path, appears as an equal amount of\nincrease in kinetic energy. (Here the effect of\nair resistance on the motion of the object has\nbeen ignored.) There is thus a continual\ntransformation of gravitational potential\nenergy into kinetic energy.

A particle of\nthe medium in contact with the vibrating\nobject is first displaced from its equilibrium\nposition. It then exerts a force on the adjacent\nparticle. As a result of which the adjacent\nparticle gets displaced from its position of\nrest. After displacing the adjacent particle the\nfirst particle comes back to its original\nposition. This process continues in the\nmedium till the sound reaches your ear. The\ndisturbance created by a source of  sound in\nthe medium travels through the medium and\nnot the particles of the medium. A wave is a disturbance that moves\nthrough a medium when the particles of the\nmedium set neighbouring particles into\nmotion. They in turn produce similar motion\nin others. The particles of the medium do not\nmove forward themselves, but the\ndisturbance is carried forward. This is what\nhappens during propagation of sound in a\nmedium, hence sound can be visualised as a\nwave. Sound waves are characterised by the\nmotion of particles in the medium and are\ncalled mechanical waves. Air is the most common medium through\nwhich sound travels.

The magnitude of the maximum\ndisturbance in the medium on either side of\nthe mean value is called the amplitude of the\nwave. It is usually represented by the letter A,\nas shown in Fig. 11.6(c). For sound its unit\nwill be that of density or pressure. The loudness or softness of a sound is\ndetermined basically by its amplitude. The\namplitude of the sound wave depends upon\nthe force with which an object is made to\nvibrate. If we strike a table lightly, we hear a\nsoft sound because we produce a sound wave\ndensity of the medium oscillates between a\nmaximum value and a minimum value. The\nchange in density from the maximum value\nto the minimum value, then again to the\nmaximum value, makes one complete\noscillation. The number of such oscillations\nper unit time is the frequency of the sound\nwave. If we can count the number of the\ncompressions or rarefactions that cross us\nper unit time, we will get the frequency of\nthe sound wave. It is usually represented by\nn (Greek letter, nu).

This sound which we\nhear is called an echo. The sensation of\nsound persists in our brain for about 0.1\ns. To hear a distinct echo the time interval\nbetween the original sound and the\nreflected one must be  at least 0.1s. If we\ntake the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a\ngiven temperature, say at 22 \u00baC in air, the\nsound must go to the obstacle and reach\nback the ear of the listener on reflection after\n0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by\nthe sound from the point of generation to\nthe reflecting surface and back should be\nat least (344 m/s) \u00d7 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus,\nfor hearing distinct echoes, the minimum\ndistance of the obstacle from the source of\nsound must be half of this distance, that\nis, 17.2 m.

How has this increase\nin production been achieved? If we think of\nthe practices involved in farming, we can see\nthat we can divide it into three stages. The\nfirst is the choice of seeds for planting. The\nsecond is the nurturing of the crop plants. The third is the protection of the growing and\nharvested crops from loss. Thus, the major\ngroups of activities for improving crop yields\ncan be classified as:\n\u2022\nCrop variety improvement\n\u2022\nCrop production improvement\n\u2022\nCrop protection management. 12.1.1 CROP VARIETY IMPROVEMENT\nThis approach depends on finding a crop\nvariety that can give a good yield. Varieties or\nstrains of crops can be selected by breeding\nfor various useful characteristics such as\ndisease resistance, response to fertilisers,\nproduct quality and high yields. One way of\nincorporating desirable characters into crop\nvarieties is by hybridisation. Hybridisation\nrefers to crossing between genetically\ndissimilar plants.

Since bee-keeping\nneeds low investments, farmers use it as an\nadditional income generating activity. In\naddition to honey, the beehives are a source\nof wax which is used in various medicinal\npreparations. The local varieties of bees used for\ncommercial honey production are Apis cerana\nindica, commonly known as the Indian bee,\nA. dorsata, the rock bee and A. florae, the little\nbee. An Italian bee variety, A. mellifera, has\nalso been brought in to increase yield of honey. This is the variety commonly used for\ncommercial honey production. The Italian bees have high honey collection\ncapacity. They sting somewhat less. They stay\nin a given beehive for long periods, and breed\nvery well. For commercial honey production,\nbee farms or apiaries are established. The value or quality of honey depends\nupon the pasturage, or the flowers available\nto the bees for nectar and pollen collection. In addition to adequate quantity of pasturage,\nthe kind of flowers available will determine\nthe taste of the honey. uestions\n1.

Galvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting\nby coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is\nprotected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you\nreason this out? Alloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal. We can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is\nthe most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is\nbecause pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is\nmixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard\nand strong.

In this Chapter, we will know\nabout the properties of carbon which make carbon so important to us. 4.1 BONDING IN CARBON \u2013 THE COVALENT BOND\nIn the previous Chapter, we have studied the properties of ionic\ncompounds. We saw that ionic compounds have high melting and boiling\npoints and conduct electricity in solution or in the molten state. We also\nReprint 2025-26\nCarbon and its Compounds\n59\nsaw how the nature of bonding in ionic compounds explains these\nproperties. Let us now study the properties of some carbon compounds. Most carbon compounds are poor conductors of electricity as we\nhave seen in Chapter 2. From the data\ngiven in Table 4.1 on the boiling and\nmelting points of the carbon compounds,\nwe find that these compounds have low\nmelting and boiling points as compared\nto ionic compounds (Chapter 3). We can\nconclude that the forces of attraction\nbetween the molecules are not very\nstrong. Since these compounds are\nlargely non-conductors of electricity, we\ncan conclude that the bonding in these\ncompounds does not give rise to any ions. In Class IX, we learnt about the\ncombining capacity of various elements and how it depends on the\nnumber of valence electrons. Let us now look at the electronic\nconfiguration of carbon. The atomic number of carbon is 6. What would\nbe the distribution of electrons in various shells of carbon? How many\nvalence electrons will carbon have? We know that the reactivity of elements is explained as their tendency\nto attain a completely filled outer shell, that is, attain noble gas\nconfiguration. Elements forming ionic compounds achieve this by either\ngaining or losing electrons from the outermost shell."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 72, "content": "In the case of carbon,\nit has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four\nelectrons to attain noble gas configuration. If it were to gain or lose\nelectrons \u2013\n(i)\nIt could gain four electrons forming C4\u2013 anion. But it would be difficult\nfor the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is,\nfour extra electrons. (ii)\nIt could lose four electrons forming C4+ cation. But it would require\na large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a\ncarbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two\nelectrons. Carbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with\nother atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements. Not just carbon,\nbut many other elements form molecules by sharing electrons in this\nmanner. The shared electrons \u2018belong\u2019 to the outermost shells of both\nthe atoms and lead to both atoms attaining the noble gas configuration. Before going on to compounds of carbon, let us look at some simple\nmolecules formed by the sharing of valence electrons. The simplest molecule formed in this manner is that of hydrogen. As you have learnt earlier, the atomic number of hydrogen is 1. Hence\nhydrogen has one electron in its K shell and it requires one more electron\nto fill the K shell.

So each atom of oxygen shares two\nelectrons with another atom of oxygen to give us the structure shown in\nFig. 4.3.

In\nfact, we ourselves are made up of carbon compounds. The numbers\nof carbon compounds whose formulae are known to chemists was\nrecently estimated to be in millions! This outnumbers by a large\nmargin the compounds formed by all the other elements put together. Why is it that this property is seen in carbon and no other element?

Two factors noticed in the case of carbon are \u2013\n(i)\nCarbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of\ncarbon, giving rise to large molecules.

No other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent\nseen in carbon compounds. Silicon forms compounds with\nhydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms, but these\ncompounds are very reactive. The carbon-carbon bond is very strong\nand hence stable. This gives us the large number of compounds\nwith many carbon atoms linked to each other.

Again the bonds that carbon forms with most other elements are\nvery strong making these compounds exceptionally stable. One\nreason for the formation of strong bonds by carbon is its small size.

Ethanol is commonly called alcohol and\nis the active ingredient of all alcoholic drinks. In addition, because it is a\ngood solvent, it is also used in medicines such as tincture iodine, cough\nsyrups, and many tonics. Ethanol is also soluble in water in all\nproportions. Consumption of small quantities of dilute ethanol causes\ndrunkenness. Even though this practice is condemned, it is a socially\nwidespread practice.

This results in lack of coordination,\nmental confusion, drowsiness, lowering of the normal inhibitions, and finally stupor. The individual may feel relaxed without realising that his sense of judgement, sense\nof timing, and muscular coordination have been seriously impaired. Unlike ethanol, intake of methanol in very small quantities can cause death. Methanol\nis oxidised to methanal in the liver. Methanal reacts rapidly with the components of\ncells.

Most dirt is\noily in nature and as you know, oil does not dissolve in water. The\nmolecules of soap are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic\nacids. The ionic-end of soap interacts with water while the carbon chain\ninteracts with oil. The soap molecules, thus form structures called\nmicelles (see Fig. 4.12) where one end of the molecules is towards the oil\ndroplet while the ionic-end faces outside. This forms an emulsion in\nwater. The soap micelle thus helps  in pulling out the dirt in water and\nwe can wash our clothes clean (Fig. 4.13). Can you draw the structure of the micelle that would be formed if\nyou dissolve soap in a hydrocarbon? Micelles\nSoaps are molecules in which the two ends have differing properties, one is hydrophilic,\nthat is, it interacts with water, while the other end is hydrophobic, that is, it interacts\nwith hydrocarbons. When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic \u2018tail\u2019 of soap\nwill not be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the\nionic end in water and the hydrocarbon \u2018tail\u2019 protruding out of water.

This energy comes from\noutside the body of the individual organism. So there must be a process\nto transfer a source of energy from outside the body of the organism,\nwhich we call food, to the inside, a process we commonly call nutrition. If the body size of the organisms is to grow, additional raw material will\nalso be needed from outside. Since life on earth depends on carbon-\nbased molecules, most of these food sources are also carbon-based. Depending on the complexity of these carbon sources, different\norganisms can then use different kinds of nutritional processes. The outside sources of energy could be quite varied, since the\nenvironment is not under the control of the individual organism. These\nsources of energy, therefore, need to be broken down or built up in the\nbody, and must be finally converted to a uniform source of energy that\ncan be used for the various molecular movements needed for\nmaintaining living structures, as well as to the kind of molecules the\nbody needs to grow. For this, a series of chemical reactions in the\nbody are necessary. Oxidising-reducing reactions are some of the most\ncommon chemical means to break-down molecules. For this, many\norganisms use oxygen sourced from outside the body."}

In the case of a single-celled organism, no specific organs for taking\nin food, exchange of gases or removal of wastes may be needed because\nthe entire surface of the organism is in contact with the environment. But what happens when the body size of the organism increases and\nthe body design becomes more complex? In multi-cellular organisms,\nall the cells may not be in direct contact with the surrounding\nenvironment. Thus, simple diffusion will not meet the requirements of\nall the cells. We have seen previously how, in multi-cellular organisms, various\nbody parts have specialised in the functions they perform. We are familiar\nwith the idea of these specialised tissues, and with their organisation in\nthe body of the organism. It is therefore not surprising that the uptake\nof food and of oxygen will also be the function of specialised tissues. However, this poses a problem, since the food and oxygen are now taken\nup at one place in the body of the organisms, while all parts of the body\nneed them. This situation creates a need for a transportation system for\ncarrying food and oxygen from one place to another in the body. When chemical reactions use the carbon source and the oxygen for\nenergy generation,  they create by-products that are not only useless\nfor the cells of the body, but could even be harmful. These waste by-\nproducts are  therefore needed to be removed from the body and discarded\noutside  by a process called excretion."}

Even when we\nare not doing any apparent activity, energy is needed to maintain a\nstate of order in our body. We also need materials from outside in order\nto grow, develop, synthesise protein and other substances needed in\nthe body. This source of energy and materials is the food we eat. How do living things get their food? The general requirement for energy and materials is common in all\norganisms, but it is fulfilled in different ways. Some organisms use simple\nfood material obtained from inorganic sources in the form of carbon\ndioxide and water. These organisms, the autotrophs, include green\nplants and some bacteria. Other organisms utilise complex substances. These complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones\nbefore they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body. To\nachieve this, organisms use bio-catalysts called enzymes. Thus, the\nheterotrophs survival depends directly or indirectly on autotrophs. Heterotrophic organisms include animals and fungi."}

Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant. We will study how this takes place in the next section.

This is actually not only water, but a fluid\ncalled saliva secreted by the salivary glands. Another aspect of the food\nwe ingest is its complex nature.

It receives the secretions of the liver\nand pancreas for this purpose. The food coming from the stomach is\nacidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act. Bile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats. Fats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes\nit difficult for enzymes to act on them.

We have seen in previous sections that blood transports food, oxygen\nand waste materials in our bodies. In Class IX, we learnt about blood\nbeing a fluid connective tissue. Blood consists of a fluid medium called\nplasma in which the cells are suspended. Plasma transports food, carbon\ndioxide and nitrogenous wastes in dissolved form. Oxygen is carried by\nthe red blood corpuscles. Many other substances like salts, are also\ntransported by the blood."}

Reprint 2025-26\nScience\n92\nThe heart is a muscular organ which is\nas big as our fist (Fig. 5.10). Because\nboth oxygen and carbon dioxide have to\nbe transported by the blood, the heart\nhas different chambers to prevent the\noxygen-rich blood from mixing with the\nblood containing carbon dioxide. The\ncarbon dioxide-rich blood has to reach\nthe lungs for the carbon dioxide to be\nremoved, and the oxygenated blood from\nthe lungs has to be brought back to the\nheart. This oxygen-rich blood is then\npumped to the rest of the body. We can follow this process step by\nstep (Fig. 5.11). Oxygen-rich blood from\nthe lungs comes to the thin-walled upper\nchamber of the heart on the left, the left atrium. The left atrium relaxes\nwhen it is collecting this blood. It then contracts, while the next chamber,\nthe left ventricle, relaxes, so that the blood is transferred to it. When the\nmuscular left ventricle contracts in its turn, the blood is pumped out to\nthe body. De-oxygenated blood comes from the body to the upper\nchamber on the right, the right atrium, as it relaxes. As the right atrium\ncontracts, the corresponding lower chamber, the right ventricle, dilates. This transfers blood to the right ventricle, which in turn pumps it to the\nlungs for oxygenation. Since ventricles have to pump blood into various\norgans, they have thicker muscular walls than the atria do. Valves ensure\nthat blood does not flow backwards when the atria or ventricles contract."}

They do not need\nthick walls because the blood is no longer under pressure, instead they\nhave valves that ensure that the blood flows only in one direction. On reaching an organ or tissue, the artery divides into smaller and\nsmaller vessels to bring the blood in contact with all the individual cells.

Through the pores present in the walls of\ncapillaries some amount of plasma, proteins and blood cells escape into\nintercellular spaces in the tissues to form the tissue fluid or lymph. It is\nsimilar to the plasma of blood but colourless and contains less protein. Lymph drains into lymphatic capillaries from the intercellular spaces,\nwhich join to form large lymph vessels that finally open into larger veins. Lymph carries digested and absorbed fat from intestine and drains excess\nfluid from extra cellular space back into the blood. 5.4.2 Transportation in Plants\nWe have discussed earlier how plants take in simple compounds such\nas CO2 and photosynthesise energy stored in their chlorophyll-containing\norgans, namely leaves. The other kinds of raw materials needed for\nbuilding plant bodies will also have to be taken up separately. For plants,\nthe soil is the nearest and richest source of raw materials like nitrogen,\nphosphorus and other minerals. The absorption of these substances\ntherefore occurs through the part in contact with the soil, namely roots. If the distances between soil-contacting organs and chlorophyll-\ncontaining organs are small, energy and raw materials can easily diffuse\nto all parts of the plant body. But if these distances become large because\nof changes in plant body design, diffusion processes will not be sufficient\nto provide raw material in leaves and energy in roots. A proper system of\ntransportation is therefore essential in such situations. Energy needs differ between different body designs. Plants do not\nmove, and plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells in many\ntissues. As a result, plants have low energy needs, and can use relatively\nslow transport systems."}

Plant transport systems will move energy stores from leaves and raw\nmaterials from roots. These two pathways are constructed as\nindependently organised conducting tubes. One, the xylem  moves water\nand minerals obtained from the soil. The other, phloem transports\nproducts of photosynthesis from the leaves where they are synthesised\nto other parts of the plant. We have studied the structure of these tissues\nin detail in Class IX. Transport of water\nIn xylem tissue, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are\ninterconnected to form a continuous system of water-conducting\nchannels reaching all parts of the plant. At the roots, cells in contact\nwith the soil actively take up ions. This creates a difference in the\nconcentration of these ions between the root and the soil. Water, therefore,\nReprint 2025-26\nLife Processes\n95\nmoves into the root from the soil to eliminate this difference. This means\nthat there is steady movement of water into root xylem, creating a column\nof water that is steadily pushed upwards. However, this pressure by itself is unlikely to be enough to move\nwater over the heights that we commonly see in plants.

Provided that the plant has an adequate\nsupply of water, the water which is lost through the\nstomata is replaced by water from the xylem vessels\nin the leaf. In fact, evaporation of water molecules from\nthe cells of a leaf creates a suction which pulls water\nfrom the xylem cells of roots. The loss of water in the\nform of vapour from the aerial parts of the plant is\nknown as transpiration. Thus, transpiration helps in the absorption and\nupward movement of water and minerals dissolved\nin it from roots to the leaves. It also helps in\ntemperature regulation. The effect of root pressure in\ntransport of water is more important at night. During\nthe day when the stomata are open, the transpiration\npull becomes the major driving force in the movement\nof water in the xylem. Transport of food and other substances\nSo far we have discussed the transport of water and minerals in plants. Now let us consider how the products of metabolic processes, particularly\nphotosynthesis, are moved from leaves, where they are formed, to other\nparts of the plant. This transport of soluble products of photosynthesis\nis called translocation and it occurs in the part of the vascular tissue\nknown as phloem. Besides the products of photosynthesis, the phloem\ntransports amino acids and other substances. These substances are\nespecially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and\nto growing organs.

Kidneys are located in the\nabdomen, one on either side of the backbone. Urine\nproduced in the kidneys passes through the ureters\ninto the urinary bladder where it is stored until it is\nreleased through the urethra. How is urine produced? The purpose of making\nurine is to filter out waste products from the blood. Just as CO2 is removed from the blood in the lungs,\nnitrogenous waste such as urea or uric acid are\nremoved from blood in the kidneys. It is then no\nsurprise that the basic filtration unit in the kidneys,\nFigure 5.13\nExcretory system in human beings\nReprint 2025-26\nLife Processes\n97\nlike in the lungs, is a cluster of very thin-walled blood\ncapillaries. Each capillary cluster in the kidney is\nassociated with the cup-shaped end of a coiled tube\ncalled Bowman\u2019s capsule that collects the filtrate\n (Fig. 5.14). Each kidney has large numbers of these\nfiltration units called nephrons packed close together. Some substances in the initial filtrate, such as glucose,\namino acids, salts and a major amount of water, are\nselectively re-absorbed as the urine flows along the tube. The amount of water re-absorbed depends on how much\nexcess water there is in the body, and on how much of\ndissolved waste there is to be excreted. The urine forming\nin each kidney eventually enters a long tube, the ureter,\nwhich connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder. Urine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure\nof the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out\nthrough the urethra."}

Several factors like infections, injury or restricted\nblood flow to kidneys reduce the activity of kidneys. This leads to accumulation of\npoisonous wastes in the body, which can even lead to death. In case of kidney\nfailure, an artificial kidney can be used. An artificial kidney is a device to remove\nnitrogenous waste products from the blood through dialysis. Artificial kidneys contain a number of tubes with a semi-permeable lining, suspended\nin a tank filled with dialysing fluid. This fluid has the same osmotic\npressure as blood, except that it is\ndevoid of nitrogenous wastes. The\npatient\u2019s blood is passed through\nthese tubes. During this passage,\nthe waste products from the blood\npass into dialysing fluid by diffusion. The purified blood is pumped back\ninto the patient. This is similar to the\nfunction of the kidney, but it is\ndifferent since there is no re-\nabsorption involved. Normally, in a\nhealthy adult, the initial filtrate in the\nkidneys is about 180 L daily. However, the volume actually\nexcreted is only a litre or two a day,\nbecause the remaining filtrate is re-\nabsorbed in the kidney tubules.

Why do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism.

Of course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking\nprocess of the brain is not fast enough. In fact many animals have very\nlittle or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is\nquite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning\nin the absence of true thought processes. However, even after complex\nneuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be\nmore efficient for quick responses.

They receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it. We also think about our actions. Writing, talking, moving a chair,\nclapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions\nwhich are based on deciding what to do next. So, the brain also has to\nsend messages to muscles. This is the second way in which the nervous\nsystem communicates with the muscles. The communication between\nthe central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated\nby the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising\nfrom the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain\nthus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking. As you\nwill expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different\nparts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs. The brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain,\nmid-brain and hind-brain. The fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions\nwhich receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas\nof the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on. There\nare separate areas of association where this sensory information is\ninterpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors\nas well as with information that is already stored in the brain.

We have seen that\nthe different parts have specific functions. Can we find out the function\nof each part? Let us look at the other use of the word \u2018reflex\u2019 that we have talked\nabout in the introduction. Our mouth waters when we see food we like\nwithout our meaning to. Our hearts beat without our thinking about it. In fact, we cannot control these actions easily by thinking about them\neven if we wanted to. Do we have to think about or remember to breathe\nor digest food? So, in between the simple reflex actions like change in\nthe size of the pupil, and the thought out actions such as moving a\nchair, there is another set of muscle movements over which we do not\nhave any thinking control. Many of these involuntary actions are\ncontrolled by the mid-brain and hind-brain. All these involuntary actions\nincluding blood pressure, salivation and vomiting are controlled by the\nmedulla in the hind-brain. Think about activities like walking in a straight line, riding a bicycle,\npicking up a pencil. These are possible due to a part of the hind-brain\ncalled the cerebellum.

If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you\nwill feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or\nbackbone which protects the spinal cord. 6.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action? So far, we have been talking about nervous tissue, and how it collects\ninformation, sends it around the body, processes information, makes\ndecisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for\naction. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed,\nmuscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When\na nerve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How\ndoes a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular\nlevel is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they\nshorten. So the next question is, how do muscle cells change their shape? The answer must lie in the chemistry of cellular components. Muscle\ncells have special proteins that change both their shape and their\narrangement in the cell in response to nervous electrical impulses. When\nthis happens, new arrangements of these proteins give the muscle cells\na shorter form.

When we touch the leaves\nof a chhui-mui (the \u2018sensitive\u2019 or \u2018touch-me-not\u2019 plant of the Mimosa\nfamily), they begin to fold up and droop.

If it is prevented\nfrom growing, it will not show any movement. So plants show two different\ntypes of movement \u2013 one dependent on growth and the other independent\nof growth. 6.2.1 Immediate Response to Stimulus\nLet us think about the first kind of movement, such as that of the sensitive\nplant. Since no growth is involved, the plant must actually move its leaves\nin response to touch. But there is no nervous tissue, nor any muscle\ntissue. How does the plant detect the touch, and how do the leaves move\nin response?"}

So, information that a touch has\noccurred must be communicated. The plants also use electrical-chemical\nmeans to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals,\nthere is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information. Finally, again as in animals, some cells must change shape in order for\nmovement to happen. Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal\nmuscle cells, plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water\nin them, resulting in swelling or shrinking, and therefore in changing\nshapes (Fig. 6.4). 6.2.2 Movement Due to Growth\nSome plants like the pea plant climb up other plants or fences by means\nof tendrils. These tendrils are sensitive to touch. When they come in\ncontact with any support, the part of the tendril in contact with the object\ndoes not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object. This causes the tendril to circle around the object and thus cling to it. More commonly, plants respond to stimuli slowly by growing in a\nparticular direction. Because this growth is directional, it appears as if\nthe plant is moving. Let us understand this type of movement with the\nhelp of an example. Reprint 2025-26\nControl and Coordination\n107\nEnvironmental triggers such as light, or gravity\nwill change the directions that plant parts grow in.

How does this help\nthe plant? Plants show tropism in response to other stimuli as well. The roots\nof a plant always grow downwards while the shoots usually grow\nupwards and away from the earth. This upward and downward growth\nof shoots and roots, respectively, in response to the pull of earth or gravity\nis, obviously, geotropism (Fig. 6.6).

Can we think of examples of these kinds of directional growth\nmovements? One example of chemotropism is the growth of pollen tubes\ntowards ovules, about which we will learn more when we examine the\nreproductive processes of living organisms. Let us now once again think about how information is communicated\nin the bodies of multicellular organisms. The movement of the\nsensitive plant in response to touch is very quick. The movement of\nsunflowers in response to day or night, on the other hand, is quite slow. Growth-related movement of plants will be even slower. Even in animal bodies, there are carefully controlled directions to\ngrowth. Our arms and fingers grow in certain directions, not haphazardly. So controlled movements can be either slow or fast. If fast responses to\nstimuli are to be made, information transfer must happen very quickly. For this, the medium of transmission must be able to move rapidly.

But there are\nlimitations to the use of electrical impulses. Firstly, they will reach only\nthose cells that are connected by nervous tissue, not each and every cell\nin the animal body. Secondly, once an electrical impulse is generated in\na cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms\nbefore it can generate and transmit a new impulse. In other words, cells\ncannot continually create and transmit electrical impulses. It is thus no\nwonder that most multicellular organisms use another means of\ncommunication between cells, namely, chemical communication. If, instead of generating an electrical impulse, stimulated cells release\na chemical compound, this compound would diffuse all around the\noriginal cell.

Different plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and\nresponses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from\nwhere they act and simply diffuse to the area of action. Let us take an example that we have worked with earlier [Activity 6.2]. When growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised\nat the shoot tip, helps the cells to grow longer. When light is coming from\none side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot. This concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the\nside of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to\nbend towards light. Another example of plant hormones are gibberellins which, like\nauxins, help in the growth of the stem. Cytokinins promote cell division,\nand it is natural then that they are present in greater concentration in\nareas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds.

These preparations\nshould ideally make it easier to do either activity in the near future. How\nwould this be achieved? If the body design in the squirrel relied only on electrical impulses\nvia nerve cells, the range of tissues instructed to prepare for the coming\nactivity would be limited. On the other hand, if a chemical signal were to\nbe sent as well, it would reach all cells of the body and provide the wide-\nranging changes needed. This is done in many animals, including human\nbeings, using a hormone called adrenaline that is secreted from the\nadrenal glands. Look at Fig. 6.7 to locate these glands.

The DNA in the cell nucleus is the information\nsource for making proteins. If the information is changed, different\nproteins will be made. Different proteins will eventually lead to altered\nbody designs. Therefore, a basic event in reproduction is the creation of a DNA\ncopy. Cells use chemical reactions to build copies of their DNA. This\ncreates two copies of the DNA in a reproducing cell, and they will need to\nbe separated from each other. However, keeping one copy of DNA in the\noriginal cell and simply pushing the other one out would not work,\nReprint 2025-26\nScience\n114\n? because the copy pushed out would not have any organised cellular\nstructure for maintaining life processes.

The consistency of DNA\ncopying during reproduction is important for the maintenance of body\ndesign features that allow the organism to use that particular niche.

{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 152, "content": "This is not true for all multi-cellular organisms. They cannot simply\ndivide cell-by-cell. The reason is that many multi-cellular organisms, as\nwe have seen, are not simply a random collection of cells. Specialised\ncells are organised as tissues, and tissues are organised into organs,\nwhich then have to be placed at definite positions in the body. In such a\ncarefully organised situation, cell-by-cell division would be impractical. Multi-cellular organisms, therefore, need to use more complex ways of\nreproduction. A basic strategy used in multi-cellular organisms is that different\ncell types perform different specialised functions. Following this general\npattern, reproduction in such organisms is also the function of a specific\ncell type. How is reproduction to be achieved from a single cell type, if\nthe organism itself consists of many cell types? The answer is that there\nmust be a single cell type in the organism that is capable of growing,\nproliferating and making other cell types under the right circumstances. 7.2.3 Regeneration\nMany fully differentiated organisms have the ability to give rise to new\nindividual organisms from their body parts. That is, if the individual is\nsomehow cut or broken up into many pieces, many of these pieces grow\ninto separate individuals. For example, simple animals like Hydra and\nPlanaria can be cut into any number of pieces and each piece grows\ninto a complete organism. This is known as regeneration (see Fig. 7.3). Regeneration is carried out by specialised cells. These cells proliferate\nand make large numbers of cells. From this mass of cells, different cells\nundergo changes to become various cell types and tissues. These changes\nReprint 2025-26\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 117\nFigure 7.3 \nFigure 7.3 \nFigure 7.3 \nFigure 7.3 \nFigure 7.3 Regeneration in Planaria\ntake place in an organised\nsequence referred to as\ndevelopment."}

In Hydra, a bud\ndevelops as an outgrowth due\nto repeated cell division at one\nspecific site (Fig. 7.4).

The callus is transferred to\nanother medium containing hormones for growth and differentiation. The plantlets\nare then placed in the soil so that they can grow into mature plants.

What is the significance of this sexual mode\nof reproduction? Are there any limitations of the asexual mode of\nreproduction, which we have been discussing above? 7.3.1 Why the Sexual Mode of Reproduction? The creation of two new cells from one involves copying of the DNA as\nwell as of the cellular apparatus."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 156, "content": "The DNA copying mechanism, as we\nhave noted, cannot be absolutely accurate, and the resultant errors are\na source of variations in populations of organisms. Every individual\norganism cannot be protected by variations, but in a population,\nvariations are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. It would\ntherefore make sense if organisms came up with reproductive modes\nthat allowed more and more variation to be generated. While DNA-copying mechanisms are not absolutely accurate, they\nare precise enough to make the generation of variation a fairly slow\nprocess. If the DNA copying mechanisms were to be less accurate, many\nof the resultant DNA copies would not be able to work with the cellular\napparatus, and would die. So how can the process of making variants\nbe speeded up? Each new variation is made in a DNA copy that already\nhas variations accumulated from previous generations. Thus, two\ndifferent individuals in a population would have quite different patterns\nof accumulated variations. Since all of these variations are in living\nindividuals, it is assured that they do not have any really bad effects. Combining variations from two or more individuals would thus create\nnew combinations of variants. Each combination would be novel, since\nit would involve two different individuals. The sexual mode of\nReprint 2025-26\nScience\n120\nreproduction incorporates such a process of combining DNA from two\ndifferent individuals during reproduction. But this creates a major difficulty. If each new generation is to be the\ncombination of the DNA copies from two pre-existing individuals, then\neach new generation will end up having twice the amount of DNA that\nthe previous generation had. This is likely to mess up the control of the\ncellular apparatus by the DNA. How many ways can we think of for\nsolving this difficulty?"}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 157, "content": "We have seen earlier that as organisms become more complex, the\nspecialisation of tissue increases. One solution that many multi-cellular\norganisms have found for the problem mentioned above is to have special\nlineages of cells in specialised organs in which only half the number of\nchromosomes and half the amount of DNA as compared to the non-\nreproductive body cells. This is achieved by a process of cell division\ncalled meiosis. Thus, when these germ-cells from two individuals combine\nduring sexual reproduction to form a new individual, it results in re-\nestablishment of the number of chromosomes and the DNA content in\nthe new generation. If the zygote is to grow and develop into an organism which has\nhighly specialised tissues and organs, then it has to have sufficient stores\nof energy for doing this. In very simple organisms, it is seen that the two\ngerm-cells are not very different from one another, or may even be similar. But as the body designs become more complex, the germ-cells also\nspecialise. One germ-cell is large and contains the food-stores while the\nother is smaller and likely to be motile. Conventionally, the motile germ-\ncell is called the male gamete and the germ-cell containing the stored\nfood is called the female gamete. We shall see in the next few sections\nhow the need to create these two different types of gametes give rise to\ndifferences in the male and female reproductive organs and, in some\ncases, differences in the bodies of the male and female organisms. 7.3.2 Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants\nThe reproductive parts of angiosperms are located in the flower. You\nhave already studied the different parts of a flower \u2013 sepals, petals,\nstamens and pistil. Stamens and pistil are\nthe reproductive parts of a flower which\ncontain the germ-cells."}

You must have seen this yellowish\npowder that often sticks to our hands if we\ntouch the stamen of a flower. Pistil is present\nin the centre of a flower and is the female\nreproductive part. It is made of three parts.

The ovary\ncontains ovules and each ovule has an egg cell. The male germ-cell\nproduced by pollen grain fuses with the female gamete present in\nthe ovule. This fusion of the germ-cells or fertilisation gives us the\nzygote which is capable of growing into a new plant. Thus the pollen needs to be transferred from the stamen to the\nstigma. If this transfer of pollen occurs in the same flower, it is\nreferred to as self-pollination. On the other hand, if the pollen is\ntransferred from one flower to another, it is known as cross-\npollination. This transfer of pollen from one flower to another is\nachieved by agents like wind, water or animals. After the pollen lands on a suitable stigma, it has to reach the\nfemale germ-cells which are in the ovary."}

But in early teenage years,\na whole new set of changes occurs that cannot be explained simply as\nbody enlargement. Instead, the appearance of the body changes. Proportions change, new features appear, and so do new sensations. Some of these changes are common to both boys and girls. We begin\nto notice thick hair growing in new parts of the body such as armpits\nand the genital area between the thighs, which can also become darker\nin colour. Thinner hair can also appear on legs and arms, as well as on\nthe face. The skin frequently becomes oily and we might begin to develop\npimples. We begin to be conscious and aware of both our own bodies\nand those of others in new ways. On the other hand, there are also changes taking place that are\ndifferent between boys and girls. In girls, breast size begins to increase,\nwith darkening of the skin of the nipples at the tips of the breasts. Also,\ngirls begin to menstruate at around this time. Boys begin to have new\nthick hair growth on the face and their voices begin to crack. Further,\nthe penis occasionally begins to become enlarged and erect, either in\ndaydreams or at night. All of these changes take place slowly, over a period of months and\nyears. They do not happen all at the same time in one person, nor do\nthey happen at an exact age."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 161, "content": "In some people, they happen early and\nquickly, while in others, they can happen slowly. Also, each change does\nnot become complete quickly either. So, for example, thick hair on the\nface in boys appears as a few scattered hairs first, and only slowly does\nthe growth begin to become uniform. Even so, all these changes show\ndifferences between people. Just as we have differently shaped noses or\nfingers, so also we have different patterns of hair growth, or size and\nshape of breast or penis. All of these changes are aspects of the sexual\nmaturation of the body. Why does the body show sexual maturation at this age? We have\ntalked about the need for specialised cell types in multi-cellular bodies\nto carry out specialised functions. The creation of germ-cells to participate\nin sexual reproduction is another specialised function, and we have seen\nthat plants develop special cell and tissue types to create them. Human\nbeings also develop special tissues for this purpose. However, while the\nbody of the individual organism is growing to its adult size, the resources\nof the body are mainly directed at achieving this growth. While that is\nhappening, the maturation of the reproductive tissue is not likely to be\na major priority. Thus, as the rate of general body growth begins to slow\ndown, reproductive tissues begin to mature. This period during\nadolescence is called puberty. So how do all the changes that we have talked about link to the\nreproductive process? We must remember that the sexual mode of\nreproduction means that germ-cells from two individuals have to join\ntogether. This can happen by the external release of germ-cells from the\nbodies of individuals, as happens in flowering plants."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 162, "content": "Or it can happen\nby two individuals joining their bodies together for internal transfer of\ngerm-cells for fusion, as happens in many animals. If animals are to\nReprint 2025-26\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 123\nparticipate in this process of mating, their state of sexual maturity must\nbe identifiable by other individuals. Many changes during puberty, such\nas new hair-growth patterns, are signals that sexual maturation is taking\nplace. On the other hand, the actual transfer of germ-cells between two\npeople needs special organs for the sexual act, such as the penis when it\nis capable of becoming erect. In mammals such as humans, the baby is\ncarried in the mother\u2019s body for a long period, and will be breast-fed\nlater. The female reproductive organs and breasts will need to mature to\naccommodate these possibilities. Let us look at the systems involved in\nthe process of sexual reproduction. 7.3.3 (a) Male Reproductive System\nThe male reproductive system (Fig. 7.10)\nconsists of portions which produce the\ngerm-cells and other portions that deliver\nthe germ-cells to the site of fertilisation. The formation of germ-cells or sperms\ntakes place in the testes. These are located\noutside the abdominal cavity in scrotum\nbecause sperm formation requires a lower\ntemperature than the normal body\ntemperature. We have discussed the role of the\ntestes in the secretion of the hormone,\ntestosterone, in the previous chapter. In\naddition to regulating the formation of sperms,\ntestosterone brings about changes in\nappearance seen in boys at the time of puberty. The sperms formed are delivered\nthrough the vas deferens which unites with\na tube coming from the urinary bladder. The\nurethra thus forms a common passage for\nboth the sperms and urine."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 163, "content": "Along the path\nof the vas deferens, glands like the prostate\nand the seminal vesicles add their secretions\nso that the sperms are now in a fluid which\nmakes their transport easier and this fluid\nalso provides nutrition. The sperms are tiny\nbodies that consist of mainly genetic\nmaterial and a long tail that helps them to\nmove towards the female germ-cell. 7.3.3 (b) Female Reproductive System\nThe female germ-cells or eggs are made in\nthe ovaries. They are also responsible for the\nproduction of some hormones. Look at\nFig. 7.11 and identify the various organs in\nthe female reproductive system.

On reaching puberty, some of these start maturing. One\negg is produced every month by one of the ovaries. The egg is carried\nfrom the ovary to the womb through a thin oviduct or fallopian tube. The two oviducts unite into an elastic bag-like structure known as the\nuterus. The uterus opens into the vagina through the cervix. The sperms enter through the vaginal passage during sexual\nintercourse. They travel upwards and reach the oviduct where they may\nencounter the egg. The fertilised egg (zygote) starts dividing and form a\nball of cells or embryo. The embryo is implanted in the lining of the uterus\nwhere they continue to grow and develop organs to become foetus. We\nhave seen in earlier sections that the mother\u2019s body is designed to\nundertake the development of the child. Hence the uterus prepares itself\nevery month to receive and nurture the growing embryo."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 164, "content": "The lining\nthickens and is richly supplied with blood to nourish the growing embryo. The embryo gets nutrition from the mother\u2019s blood with the help of a\nspecial tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the\nuterine wall. It contains villi on the embryo\u2019s side of the tissue. On the\nmother\u2019s side are blood spaces, which surround the villi. This provides\na large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to\nthe embryo. The developing embryo will also generate waste substances\nwhich can be removed by transferring them into the mother\u2019s blood\nthrough the placenta. The development of the child inside the mother\u2019s\nbody takes approximately nine months. The child is born as a result of\nrhythmic contractions of the muscles in the uterus. 7.3.3 (c) What happens when the Egg is not Fertilised? If the egg is not fertilised, it lives for about one day. Since the ovary\nreleases one egg every month, the uterus also prepares itself every month\nto receive a fertilised egg. Thus its lining becomes thick and spongy. This would be required for nourishing the embryo if fertilisation had\ntaken place. Now, however, this lining is not needed any longer. So, the\nlining slowly breaks and comes out through the vagina as blood and\nmucous. This cycle takes place roughly every month and is known as\nmenstruation. It usually lasts for about two to eight days. 7.3.3 (d) Reproductive Health\nAs we have seen, the process of sexual maturation is gradual, and takes\nplace while general body growth is still going on. Therefore, some degree\nof sexual maturation does not necessarily mean that the body or the\nmind is ready for sexual acts or for having and bringing up children."}

All of us are under many different kinds of pressures\nabout these issues. There can be pressure from our friends for\nparticipating in many activities, whether we really want to or not.

In this situation, making choices can become very difficult. Reprint 2025-26\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 125\nWe must also consider the possible health consequences of having\nsex. We have discussed in Class IX that diseases can be transmitted\nfrom person to person in a variety of ways. Since the sexual act is a\nvery intimate connection of bodies, it is not surprising that many\ndiseases can be sexually transmitted. These include bacterial infections\nsuch as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as warts\nand HIV-AIDS. Is it possible to prevent the transmission of such diseases\nduring the sexual act? Using a covering, called a condom, for the penis\nduring sex helps to prevent transmission of many of these infections to\nsome extent. The sexual act always has the potential to lead to pregnancy. Pregnancy will make major demands on the body and the mind of the\nwoman, and if she is not ready for it, her health will be adversely\naffected. Therefore, many ways have been devised to avoid pregnancy. These contraceptive methods fall in a number of categories. One\ncategory is the creation of a mechanical barrier so that sperm does not\nreach the egg. Condoms on the penis or similar coverings worn in the\nvagina can serve this purpose."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 166, "content": "Another category of contraceptives acts\nby changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not\nreleased and fertilisation cannot occur. These drugs commonly need\nto be taken orally as pills. However, since they change hormonal\nbalances, they can cause side-effects too.

If the vas deferens in the male is blocked, sperm transfer will\nbe prevented. If the fallopian tube in the female is blocked, the egg will\nnot be able to reach the uterus. In both cases fertilisation will not take\nplace. Surgical methods can be used to create such blocks. While\nsurgical methods are safe in the long run, surgery itself can cause\ninfections and other problems if not performed properly. Surgery can\nalso be used for removal of unwanted pregnancies. These may be\nmisused by people who do not want a particular child, as happens in\nillegal sex-selective abortion of female foetuses. For a healthy society,\nthe female-male sex ratio must be maintained. Because of reckless\nfemale foeticides, child sex ratio is declining at an alarming rate in\nsome sections of our society, although prenatal sex determination has\nbeen prohibited by law. We have noted earlier that reproduction is the process by which\norganisms increase their populations. The rates of birth and death in a\ngiven population will determine its size. The size of the human population\nis a cause for concern for many people. This is because an expanding\npopulation makes it harder to improve everybody\u2019s standard of living. However, if inequality in society is the main reason for poor standards of\nliving for many people, the size of the population is relatively unimportant."}

{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 172, "content": "This meant that only one of the parental traits\nwas seen, not some mixture of the two. So the next\nquestion was, were the tall plants in the F1\ngeneration exactly the same as the tall plants of the\nparent generation? Mendelian experiments test this\nby getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall\nplants to reproduce by self-pollination. The progeny\nof the parental plants are, of course, all tall. However,\nthe second-generation, or F2, progeny of the F1 tall\nplants are not all tall. Instead, one quarter of them\nare short. This indicates that both the tallness and\nshortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants, but\nonly the tallness trait was expressed. This led Mendel\nto propose that two copies of factor (now called genes)\ncontrolling traits are present in sexually reproducing\norganism. These two may be identical, or may be\ndifferent, depending on the parentage. A pattern of\ninheritance can be worked out with this assumption,\nas shown in Fig. 8.3.

You can see as to how new combinations of\ntraits are formed in F2 offspring when factors controlling for seed\nshape and seed colour recombine to form zygote leading to form\nF2 offspring (Fig. 8.5). Thus, the tall/short trait and the round\nseed/wrinkled seed trait are independently inherited. 8.2.3 How do these Traits get Expressed? How does the mechanism of heredity work? Cellular DNA is\nthe information source for making proteins in the cell. A section\nof DNA that provides information for one protein is called the\ngene for that protein. How do proteins control the\ncharacteristics that we are discussing here? Let us take the\nexample of tallness as a characteristic. We know that plants\nhave hormones that can trigger growth. Plant height can thus\ndepend on the amount of a particular plant hormone. The\namount of the plant hormone made will depend on the\nefficiency of the process for making it. Consider now an enzyme\nthat is important for this process. If this enzyme works\nefficiently, a lot of hormone will be made, and the plant will be\ntall. If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration that makes\nthe enzyme less efficient, the amount of hormone will be less,\nand the plant will be short. Thus, genes control characteristics,\nor traits. If the interpretations of Mendelian experiments we have been\ndiscussing are correct, then both parents must be contributing\nequally to the DNA of the progeny during sexual reproduction. We have disscussed this issue in the previous Chapter. If both\nparents can help determine the trait in the progeny, both parents\nmust be contributing a copy of the same gene."}

For this mechanism to work, each germ cell must\nhave only one gene set. How do germ-cells make a single set of genes from the normal two\ncopies that all other cells in the body have? If progeny plants inherited a\nsingle whole gene set from each parent, then the experiment explained\nin Fig. 8.5 cannot work. This is because the two characteristics \u2018R\u2019 and\n\u2018y\u2019 would then be linked to each other and cannot be independently\nFigure 8.4\nFigure 8.4\nFigure 8.4\nFigure 8.4\nFigure 8.4\nReprint 2025-26\nScience\n132\ninherited. This is explained by the fact that each gene set is present, not\nas a single long thread of DNA, but as separate independent pieces,\neach called a chromosome. Thus, each cell will have two copies of each\nchromosome, one each from the male and female parents. Every germ-\ncell will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either\nmaternal or paternal origin. When two germ cells combine, they will\nrestore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring\nthe stability of the DNA of the species.

However,\nin human beings, the sex of the individual is largely\ngenetically determined. In other words, the genes inherited\nfrom our parents decide whether we will be boys or girls. But so far, we have assumed that similar gene sets are\ninherited from both parents. If that is the case, how can\ngenetic inheritance determine sex? The explanation lies in the fact that all human\nchromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes\nhave a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22\nsuch pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is\nodd in not always being a perfect pair. Women have a\nperfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men\nhave a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X\nwhile the other is a short one called Y. So women are XX,\nwhile men are XY. Now, can we work out what the\ninheritance pattern of X and Y will be? As Fig. 8.6 shows, half the children will be boys and\nhalf will be girls.

There are a number of common wonderful phenomena\nassociated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling\nof stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium\nand so on. A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them. By observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may\nconclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a small\nsource of light casts a sharp shadow of an opaque object points to this\nstraight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light. More to Know!

What do you observe? Why? The paper at first begins to burn producing smoke. Eventually it\nmay even catch fire. Why does it burn? The light from the Sun is converged\nat a point, as a sharp, bright spot by the mirror. In fact, this spot of light\nis the image of the Sun on the sheet of paper. This point is\nthe focus of the concave mirror. The heat produced due to\nthe concentration of sunlight ignites the paper. The distance\nof this image from the position of the mirror gives the\napproximate value of focal length of the mirror. Let us try to understand this observation with the help\nof a ray diagram. Observe Fig.9.2 (a) closely. A number of rays parallel\nto the principal axis are falling on a concave mirror. Observe\nthe reflected rays."}

The surface, then, has a circular outline. The diameter of the reflecting\nsurface of spherical mirror is called its aperture. In Fig.9.2, distance MN\nrepresents the aperture. We shall consider in our discussion only such\nspherical mirrors whose aperture is much smaller than its radius of\ncurvature. Is there a relationship between the radius of curvature R, and focal\nlength f, of a spherical mirror? For spherical mirrors of small apertures,\nthe radius of curvature is found to be equal to twice the focal length. We\nput this as R = 2f . This implies that the principal focus of a spherical\nmirror lies midway between the pole and centre of curvature. 9.2.1  Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors\nYou have studied about the image formation by plane mirrors.

These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling the\ndriver to see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving.

{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 197, "content": "The light ray at point O has\nentered from a rarer medium to a denser medium, that is, from air to\nglass. Note that the light ray has bent towards\nthe normal. At O\u2032, the light ray has entered\nfrom glass to air, that is, from a denser\nmedium to a rarer medium. The light here\nhas bent away from the normal. Compare the\nangle of incidence with the angle of refraction\nat both refracting surfaces AB and CD. In Fig. 9.10, a ray EO is obliquely\nincident on surface AB, called incident ray. OO\u2032 is the refracted ray and O\u2032 H is the\nemergent ray. You may observe that the\nemergent ray is parallel to the direction of\nthe incident ray. Why does it happen so? The\nextent of bending of the ray of light at the\nopposite parallel faces AB (air-glass interface)\nand CD (glass-air interface) of the rectangular\nglass slab is equal and opposite. This is why\nthe ray emerges parallel to the incident ray. However, the light ray is shifted sideward\nslightly. What happens when a light ray is\nincident normally to the interface of two\nmedia?

The extent of the change in direction that takes place\nin a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,\nthe \u201cconstant\u201d appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4). The refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,\nthe relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns\nout that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light\ntravels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3\u00d7108 m s\u20131. In air, the speed of\nlight is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces\nconsiderably in glass or water. The value of the refractive index for a\ngiven pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as\ngiven below. Consider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as\nshown in Fig.9.11. Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the\nspeed of light in medium 2. The refractive index of medium 2 with respect\nto medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and\nthe speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol\nn21. This can be expressed in an equation form as\nn21= Speed of light in medium 1 \nSpeed of light in medium 2 = v\nv\n1\n2\n(9.5)\nBy the same argument, the refractive index of medium\n1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n12."}

Optical density has a definite connotation. It is not the same as mass density. We have\nbeen using the terms \u2018rarer medium\u2019 and \u2018denser medium\u2019 in this Chapter. It actually\nmeans  \u2018optically rarer medium\u2019 and \u2018optically denser medium\u2019, respectively. When can\nwe say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the\none with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other. The other\nmedium of lower refractive index is optically rarer. The speed of light is higher in a rarer\nmedium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a\ndenser medium slows down and bends  towards the normal. When it travels from a\ndenser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal. Note from Table 9.3 that an optically denser medium may not possess\ngreater mass density. For example, kerosene having higher refractive\nindex, is optically denser than water, although its mass density is less\nthan water."}

It enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On\nclosing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell,\ntaste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however, impossible to identify\ncolours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human\neye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful,\ncolourful world around us. The human eye is like a camera. Its lens\nsystem forms an image on a light-sensitive\nscreen called the retina. Light enters the eye\nthrough a thin membrane called the cornea. It forms the transparent bulge on the front\nsurface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1. The eyeball is approximately spherical in shape\nwith a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the\nrefraction for the light rays entering the eye\noccurs at the outer surface of the cornea."}

The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the object\non the retina. The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous\nnumber of light-sensitive cells. The light-sensitive cells get activated\nupon illumination and generate electrical signals. These signals are\nsent to the brain via the optic nerves. The brain interprets these signals,\nand finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as\nthey are. 10.1.1 Power of Accommodation\nThe eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature\ncan be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the\ncurvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the\nmuscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length\nincreases. This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are\nlooking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This\nincreases the curvature of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker. Consequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases. This enables\nus to see nearby objects clearly. The ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called\naccommodation. However, the focal length of the eye lens cannot be\ndecreased below a certain minimum limit. Try to read a printed page by\nholding it very close to your eyes."}

For a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about\n25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is\ncalled the far point of the eye.

Yet something makes each colour distinct from the other. The splitting\nof light into its component colours is called dispersion. You have seen that white light is dispersed\ninto its seven-colour components by a prism. Why do we get these colours? Different colours\nof light bend through different angles with\nrespect to the incident ray, as they pass\nthrough a prism. The red light bends the least\nwhile the violet the most. Thus the rays of each\ncolour emerge along different paths and thus\nbecome distinct. It is the band of distinct\ncolours that we see in a spectrum. Isaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain\nthe spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of\nthe spectrum of white light further by using another similar\nprism. However, he could not get any more colours. He\nthen placed a second identical prism in an inverted position\nwith respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This\nallowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through\nthe second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging\nfrom the other side of the second prism.

The air just above the fire becomes\nhotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense)\nthan the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly\nless than that of the cooler air. Since the physical conditions of\nthe refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent\nposition of the object, as seen through the hot air, fluctuates. This wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction\nof light by the earth\u2019s atmosphere) on a small scale in our local\nenvironment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on\na much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 227, "content": "Twinkling of stars\nThe twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The\nstarlight, on entering the earth\u2019s atmosphere, undergoes refraction\ncontinuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction\noccurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the\natmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position\nof the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears\nslightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the\nhorizon (Fig. 10.9). Further, this apparent position of the star is not\nstationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions\nof the earth\u2019s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the\nprevious paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate\npoint-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from\nthe star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star\nfluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers \u2013 the\nstar sometimes appears brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which\nis the twinkling effect. Why don\u2019t the planets twinkle? The planets are much\ncloser to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources. If we consider a planet as a collection of a large number\nof point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the\namount of light entering our eye from all the individual\npoint-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby\nnullifying the twinkling effect.

The blue colour of the sky, colour of\nwater in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset\nare some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous\nclass, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles. The path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible. However, its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where the\nsize of the particles is relatively larger. 10.6.1 Tyndall Effect\nThe earth\u2019s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles. These particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles\nof dust and molecules of air. When a beam of light strikes such fine\nparticles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us,\nafter being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of\nscattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect\nwhich you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a\nfine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole. Thus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can\nalso be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense\nforest. Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light."}
{"source": "science_class_10.pdf", "chunk_id": 229, "content": "The colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering\nparticles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of\nlarger size scatter light of longer wavelengths. If the size of the scattering\nparticles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear\nwhite. 10.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue? The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size\nsmaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in\nscattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer\nwavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8\ntimes greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the\natmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter\nwavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters\nour eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been\nany scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark.

A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an\nelectric circuit.

Electric current is expressed by\nthe amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In\nother words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using\nmetallic wires, electrons constitute the flow of charges. However, electrons\nwere not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first\nobserved. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive\ncharges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the\ndirection of electric current.

In our country, the\npotential difference between the two is 220 V.\nAt the meter-board in the house, these wires pass into an electricity\nmeter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are connected\nto the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separate\ncircuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of\n15 A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as\ngeysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5 A current rating for\nbulbs, fans, etc. The earth wire, which has insulation of green colour, is\nusually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house. This is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that\nhave a metallic body, for example, electric press, toaster, table fan,\nrefrigerator, etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which\nprovides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it\nensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance\nkeeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe\nelectric shock. 2."}

This series or organisms taking part at\nvarious biotic levels form a food chain (Fig. 13.1). Each step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level. The autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level. They fix up the solar energy and make it available for\nheterotrophs or the consumers. The herbivores or the primary\nconsumers come at the second, small carnivores or the\nsecondary consumers at the third and larger carnivores or\nthe tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level (Fig. 13.2).

In Grade 7, we will try to ask deeper questions: How do things \nwork? Why do events happen the way they do? And what can \nwe learn from the patterns that we see in nature? To do this, we have to step out of this book, step out of the \nclassroom perhaps, and experience the world through activities \nand experiments. These are experiences that we hope will not \njust be interesting or exciting but also serve as stepping stones \nto a deeper understanding of the environment we live in and of \nour place on this planet. We believe that this will also help you \nto see science as an ongoing process of discovery. And not just \nabout discovery alone, but also about responsibility. As young \nscience explorers, you will soon see how human activities are \nlinked to what happens in the natural world and are connected \nto the society we live in. You will, we hope, also see the role that \nscience can play in addressing environmental challenges and \nhelp in creating a more sustainable world. But let\u2019s get back into this book for now.

Can you \ufb01 nd the reason \nfor the di\ufb00 erence? 3.2.5 An electrical circuit\nThe lamp glows when one terminal of the lamp is connected to \none terminal of the electric cell and the other terminal of the \nlamp to the other terminal of the cell as shown in Fig.\u00a03.9. This \nsetup forms an electrical circuit, which provides a \ncomplete path for electric current to \ufb02 ow through \nthe lamp. The lamp glows only when current passes \nthrough the circuit. The direction of electric current in an electrical \ncircuit is taken to be from the positive to the negative \nterminal of the electric cell. When the terminals of \nthe lamp are connected with those of the electric cell \nby wires, the current passes through the \ufb01 lament \nof the incandescent lamp and makes it glow. With \nan incandescent lamp, it does not matter which of \nits terminals connects to the positive or negative \nterminal of the cell. The lamp will glow as long as \nthe circuit is complete and current \ufb02 ows through \nthe \ufb01 lament. FASCINATING FACTS\nSometimes, an incandescent lamp does not glow even when \nconnected to a cell. We say the lamp has \u2018fused\u2019 usually due to \na broken \ufb01 lament. A broken \ufb01 lament stops the \ufb02 ow of current, \npreventing the lamp from glowing. Let us now try to make an LED glow."}

{"source": "science_class_7.pdf", "chunk_id": 41, "content": "\uf076What does this experiment tell us about heat transfer along \nthe two spoons? You may have noticed that the metal spoon is hotter to touch \nthan the wooden spoon. Even though both spoons are immersed \nin the water of the same temperature and for the same time. This \nshows that the heat transfers through the metal spoon, making it \nhotter. In contrast, the wooden spoon transfers heat poorly. In such cases, the transfer of heat from one point to another \nof a material is called conduction, and materials that transfer \nheat are called conductors. Based on the observations, one can say that metals are good \nconductors of heat, whereas wood is a poor conductor of heat. Now, we can understand why mostly metal vessels are used \nfor cooking, and their handles are made with wood or other \nmaterials that do not conduct heat. You will learn more about \nthis in the chapter \u2018Heat Transfer in Nature\u2019. 4.1.5 Conduction of electricity\nHave you ever seen an electrician using a screwdriver?

Do \nyou see any pattern in the glowing of bulbs when using di\ufb00 erent \nmaterials in Activity 4.4? It is observed that all the materials that \nmake the bulb glow are metals. Materials that allow electricity to \ufb02 ow through them easily \nare called good conductors of electricity. In contrast, materials \nthat prevent the bulb from glowing by not allowing electricity to \npass through them are called poor conductors of electricity. So, now we can understand that the plastic covering on \nscrewdrivers and rubber gloves protect the electrician from \nelectric shock because these materials are poor conductors of \nelectricity.

This indicates that brown deposits or discolouration on the iron \nnails do not develop when the iron nail is kept in dry air alone \n(bottle A) or water alone (bottle B). However, in glass bottle C, the \niron nail shows the presence of brown deposits. This indicates that \nthe presence of both water and air is essential for these deposits \nto develop. Thus, moist air is responsible for the development of \nbrown deposits on objects made of iron. This brown deposit is \ncalled rust. The process of formation of rust on objects made of \niron is called rusting. Many other metals also exhibit discolouration when kept open \nin the atmosphere. Have you noticed the formation of a green \ncoating on the surface of copper objects or a black coating on the \nsurface of silver objects?

Many changes in adolescence, including menstruation and \nother signs of puberty, are mainly due to hormones\u2009\u2014\u2009certain \nchemicals produced in our bodies. Hormones play a crucial \nrole in regulating various aspects of growth and development, \ncontributing to the proper functioning of the body. They are \nproduced in different parts of the body and are released at an \nappropriate time in response to signals from the brain. Some \nhormones influence mood and behaviour."}

In a Nutshell\n\t\n\u0099 Adolescence is the period of change from childhood to \nadulthood. It generally begins around the age of 10 years \nand usually lasts until 19 years. \u0099 Adolescence is marked by significant and characteristic \nphysical, biological, and emotional changes. \u0099 Features that help to distinguish the male from the female \nbut are not directly involved in reproduction are called \nsecondary sexual characteristics. \u0099 Puberty is the stage in which the body of a child undergoes \nobservable and internal changes to develop into an adult \ncapable of reproduction. \u0099 Adolescence in girls is also marked by start of the menstrual \ncycle, during which there is a discharge of blood generally \nafter every 28\u201330 days, a process called menstruation. Menstruation begins at puberty and generally ends by the \nage of 45\u201355 years. \u0099 Adolescents face several emotional and behavioural changes. \u0099 Eating a balanced and healthy diet, maintaining good \npersonal hygiene, and participating in physical activities \nhelp adolescents to stay healthy. \u0099 Addictive substances, such as tobacco, alcohol, and drugs, \nhave adverse effects on the body and mind. It is wise to say \n\u2018NO\u2019 to these substances and stay away from them. \u0099 Changes that take place in the body during adolescence are \nprimarily controlled by certain chemicals produced in the \nbody. These chemicals are called hormones. \u0099 Proper guidance and awareness help adolescents manage \nphysical, emotional, and behavioural changes effectively. Let Us Enhance Our Learning\n1.

It \nis because of convection that we see the movement of the \ncoloured streak inside the beaker. Thus, we can conclude that water, like air, gets heated \nup by the process of convection. Here, heat transfer takes \nplace by the actual movement of particles of liquids and \ngases from one place to another.

You may have observed that water seeps fastest through \ngravel, slower through sand, and slowest through clay. Why \nis it so? The spaces between gravel particles are wider when \ncompared to those in sand and clay. Hence, water can seep \nthrough the gravel more easily. In this way, water seeps \nbeneath the surface of the Earth. This process of surface water \nseeping through soil and rocks is called in\ufb01 ltration. Water \ncan in\ufb01 ltrate more readily if the spaces between soil and \nrock particles are wider, open, and interconnected (Fig. 7.11). The water that seeps through gets stored in the pore spaces \nof sediments and the openings in rocks beneath the surface \nas groundwater. The underground layers of sediments and \nrocks that store water in pore spaces are called aquifers \n(Fig. 7.12).

Activity 12.4: Let us explore\n\uf076Ask your friend to stand in front of you at a distance of about \n5 metres. Consider his head to be the Sun. \uf076Now close one eye and show a thumbs up with your \noutstretched hand towards your friend as shown in Fig. 12.12. Are you able to cover the entire head of your friend with your \nthumb? You can cover the entire head of your friend \nwith the help of your thumb, even though your \nthumb is much smaller than the actual size of \nyour friend\u2019s head. How could it be? The size of \nany object as seen by your eye \u2014 also known as \napparent size \u2014 depends upon both its actual \nphysical size and its distance from you. The \nthumb being much closer to you as compared to \nyour friend, the apparent sizes of your thumb and \nyour friend\u2019s head as seen by you in Activity 12.4 \nare similar. The apparent sizes of the Moon and the Sun in the sky are \nsimilar when viewed from the Earth. This is so because though \nthe Moon is much smaller in physical size than the Sun, the Moon \nis much closer to us compared to the Sun. Therefore, the Moon \ncan appear to cover the entire Sun as viewed from the Earth."}

During a total solar eclipse, for a few minutes it turns dark \nduring the day as no sunlight reaches the Earth. Due to the \nEarth\u2019s rotation and the motion of the Moon in its orbit, the \nMoon\u2019s shadow moves across the surface of the Earth. Thus, the \ntotal solar eclipse is visible only for a few minutes."}

Safe Viewing of a Solar Eclipse\nCaution\u2014 During a solar eclipse, one might be tempted to look at the \nSun, thinking that it wouldn\u2019t be strong enough to cause harm to our \neyes. However, even during the eclipse, the Sun is intense enough to \ndamage the eyes and cause blindness. Thus, directly viewing solar \neclipse must be strictly avoided. Also, do not view it through sunglasses, \nbinoculars, or telescopes. Usually, \nastronomy \norganisations, such as planetaria \nand astronomy clubs hold eclipse \nviewing events during a solar \neclipse (Fig. 12.15). Participating in such events \nis the best way to observe a solar \neclipse since the organisers not \nonly provide specialised eye \nprotection for solar viewing, but \nalso o\ufb00 er scienti\ufb01 c explanations.

A mirror can be used to project an image of the \nSun onto a wall. However, holding it at the correct angle \nthroughout a solar eclipse can be di\ufb03  cult. To solve this, make \na movable stand for the mirror. Use a hollow ball with a small \nhole, half-\ufb01 ll it with sand (to keep it stable), and attach a small \nmirror (such as an embroidery mirror) to it."}

When the reasons for eclipses were not known, they \nfeared the occurrence of eclipses. As you can imagine, something \nblocking the Sun, the main source of heat and light on the Earth, \neven for a brief period of time, would have been extremely \nconcerning. Many superstitions were attached to solar eclipses in \nvarious parts of the world related to the activities that could not \nbe carried out during eclipses\u2014such as eating, cooking, or going \nout of home. But now that we know the reason why a solar eclipse \noccurs, we need not fear these events as long as we do not look at \nthe Sun directly. In fact, scientists go around the world to observe \nthe eclipses from wherever these are observable. The eclipses \nprovide them an opportunity to study phenomena that cannot be \nobserved otherwise. FASCINATING FACTS\nAn eclipse is known as grahan in Sanskrit and in many Indian languages. Many ancient Indian astronomical texts provide calculations to \npredict eclipses. The best known and most referred text is the Surya\nSiddhanta, which is written in the classical Sanskrit poetry tradition \nin rhythmic shlokas. 12.3.2 Lunar eclipse\nAs the Moon revolves around the Earth, sometimes the Earth can \nblock the sunlight from reaching the Moon."}
